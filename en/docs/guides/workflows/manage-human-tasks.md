# Manage Human Tasks

Human tasks are the steps that require human interaction in order to allow the process of the operation to proceed. Follow the steps below to test the workflow.

1.  Sign in to WSO2 Identity Server with the admin credentials.
2.  Create a user with the name `Alex`. After you successfully create the
    user, it will be greyed out as shown below until a manager approves
    the addition of the user account.

    !!! tip
        All pending status workflows are denoted in this manner with
        disabled or greyed out functions.

!!! info 
    The workflow comes with some advanced features such as:

    -   Multi-step approvals
    -   User specific approvals
    -   Multiple role based approvals

    Instead of a one-step approval, there can be multiple steps to the approval flow. For example, a workflow with two-step approval where in the first step the role to authorize the request is the Manager and in the second step the role to authorize the request is the SeniorManager. In this case, when a user is added to the system, only users with Manager role can initially see the pending approvals. After the users with this role approves the pending tasks, then the users with SeniorManager role can see the pending tasks. After both the users approve, the task is completed.
