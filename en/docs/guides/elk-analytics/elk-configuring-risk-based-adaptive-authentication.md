# Configure risk-based adaptive authentication

This guide shows you how to use ELK Analytics to assess an end user's risk score and enable adaptive authentication.

## Scenario
Consider a business use case where a bank wants to prompt an additional authentication step when a user attempts to log in to the system after making transactions amounting to over $10,000 within five minutes.


The diagram below shows how the connection between the client applications, ELK Analytics, and WSO2 Identity Server
works to assess the risk of the user.

![risk-based-adaptive-authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/elk-analytics/risk-based-adaptive-authentication/risk-based-adaptive-authentication-1.png)

1. The user performs bank transactions through different applications.
2. Transaction data from all these applications are published to the ELK Analytics via the “transaction” index.
3. The user attempts to access an application that uses WSO2 IS as the identity provider.
4. The application sends an authentication request to WSO2 IS.
5. The user is prompted to log in, and WSO2 IS authenticates the user using basic authentication (username/password credentials).
6. WSO2 IS publishes an event to ELK, which computes the user's risk score based on the user's transaction history using the data received in step 2.
    
    !!! info "For example"
         If the user has made transactions that add up to over $10,000 within the last five minutes, the risk score is 1. Else, the risk score is 0.

7. If the risk score is 1, WSO2 IS prompts an additional step of authentication for the user (i.e., entering a hardware
   key number) before allowing the user to access the service provider application.

## Prerequisites

- You need to [set up the sample]({{base_path}}/guides/adaptive-auth/adaptive-auth-overview/#set-up-the-sample) application.
- You need to [configure ELK analytics for adaptive authentication]({{base_path}}/deploy/using-elk-analytics-for-adaptive-authentication), and run the following command to create an index named `transaction` to store transaction data.

    !!! info
        Replace `{ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}` and `{ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER}` to match your settings.

    !!! abstract ""
        **Request Format**
        ```
        curl -L -X PUT 'https://{ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}/transaction' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"mappings":{"properties":{"@timestamp":{"type":"date"}}}}'
        ```
        **Sample Request**
        ```
        curl -L -X PUT 'https://localhost:9200/transaction' -H 'Authorization: Basic d3NvMnVzZXI6Y2hhbmdlbWU= -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"mappings":{"properties":{"@timestamp":{"type":"date"}}}}'
        ```
        **Response**
        ```
        {
        "acknowledged": true,
        "shards_acknowledged": true,
        "index": "transaction"
        }
        ```

## Configure risk-based authentication

To configure risk-based authentication:

1. On the management console, go to **Main** > **Identity** > **Service Providers** > **List**.

2. Click **Edit** on the `saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com` service provider.

3. Expand the **Local and Outbound Authentication Configuration** section and click **Advanced Configuration**.

4. You will be redirected to **Advanced Configuration**, expand **Script Based Conditional Authentication**.

5. In the **Templates** section, click on the **`+`** corresponding to the **ELK-Risk-Based** template.
   ![template-for-risk-based-authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/elk-analytics/risk-based-adaptive-authentication/risk-based-adaptive-authentication-2.png)

6. Click **Ok** to add the authentication script. The authentication script and authentication steps will be configured.
   
    !!! info
         - The resulting authentication script defines a conditional step that executes the second authentication step if the `riskScore` is greater than 0.
         - By default, `TOTP` will be added as the second authentication step. You can update this with any authentication method.

7. Click **Update** to save your configurations and restart WSO2 Identity Server.

## Try it out

1. Start the Tomcat server and access the following sample PickUp application URL: `http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com` .

2. Log in to the application by giving your username and password.

    !!! note
         The user is authenticated with basic authentication only.

3. Log out of the application, and execute the following cURL command. This command publishes an event regarding a user bank transaction exceeding $10,000.

    !!! abstract ""
        **Request**
        ```
        curl -L -X POST 'https://{ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}/transaction/_doc' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
        "@timestamp":"{CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}",
        "username":"{USERNAME}",
        "amount": {TRANSACTION_AMOUNT}
        }'
        ```
        **Sample Request**
        ``` 
        curl -L -X POST 'https://localhost:9200/transaction/_doc' -H 'Authorization: Basic d3NvMnVzZXI6Y2hhbmdlbWU=' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
        "@timestamp":"{{'{{currenttimestamp}}'}}",
        "username":"Alex",
        "amount": 12000
        }'
        ```
        **Response**
        ```
        {
        "_index": "transaction",
        "_id": "_75YR4EBPqDnJYiU7W_A",
        "_version": 1,
        "result": "created",
        "_shards": {
         "total": 2,
         "successful": 1,
         "failed": 0
        },
        "_seq_no": 0,
        "_primary_term": 1
        }
        ```

5. Log in to the application again. You are now prompted for the `TOTP` after the basic authentication.


    !!! info
        Before executing the cURL command given in step 4, the user had no
        transaction history, and the user's riskScore was 0. The authentication script is programmed to prompt only basic authentication if the risk score is 0.

        After executing the command, a transaction event that indicates the user spending more than $10,000 is published and recorded in the Siddhi application. Therefore, when the user attempts to log in again, the user's riskScore is evaluated to 1, and the user is prompted for an extra authentication step.
