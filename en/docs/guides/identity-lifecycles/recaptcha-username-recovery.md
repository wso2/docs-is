# Configure reCAPTCHA for account recovery

The user account recovery feature implemented in the WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) helps to recover the username of the account if the user has forgotten it. This recovery process is also secured with captchaÂ verification.

By configuring reCAPTCHA, you can mitigate or block brute force attacks.
