# Configure Outbound Provisioning with Salesforce

The WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) has the ability to provision users
into different domains like Salesforce, Google, Facebook, etc., using
its [identity provisioning framework](../../../references/concepts/provisioning-framework/).

This topic provides instructions on how to configure Salesforce as the
Identity Provider to provision users from WSO2 Identity Server. The
service provider in this scenario is WSO2 Identity Server. When WSO2 IS
is the service provider, it is configured as the resident Service
Provider. Therefore, after completing this tutorial you can see the
users you add using WSO2 Identity Server being created in Salesforce
too.

        Full access (full) allows access to the logged-in user’s data, and encompasses all other scopes. Full does not return a refresh token. You must explicitly request the refresh_token scope to get one.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        </div></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        ![new-connected-app](/assets/img/guides/fill-connected-app.png) 

    4.  Click **Save** > **Continue** to add the connected app.

5.  <a name ="step5"></a>The resulting screen displays key information that you will need to
    configure WSO2 IS to Salesforce.  
    Make a note of the following details as you need them in upcoming
    configurations.

    1.  Consumer Key
    2.  Consumer Secret (Click the **Click to reveal** link to view the
        consumer secret)
    3.  Callback URL

    !!! info
        **Consumer Key** : A value used by the consumer to identify itself
        to Salesforce. Referred to as `client_id` in OAuth 2.0.
        **Consumer Secret** : A secret used by the consumer to establish
        ownership of the consumer key. Referred to as `client_secret` in
        OAuth 2.0.

    ![consumer-secret](/assets/img/guides/connected-app-screen.png) 

6.  <a name="step6"></a>Add your connected app to the profile you are going to use. This is
    necessary as this profile is used when you add users in to
    Salesforce from the Identity Server.

    !!! note
        Allow from 2-10 minutes for your changes to take effect on the
        server before using the connected app.
    
    1.  Expand **Users** in the **Administration** section of the left hand panel and click **Profiles**. A list of existing
        profiles can be viewed.  
        ![user-profiles](/assets/img/guides/profiles.png) 

    2.  As an example, if you use the profile “Chatter Free User”, click
        **Edit** and select the connected app you created to configure
        with the Identity Server using the provided checkbox.  
         
        ![select-connected-app](/assets/img/guides/example-app.png) 

    3.  Click **Save**. Make a note of the profile ID (or address URL obtained from the address bar in your browser)
        of the Chatter Free User profile.

        !!! tip
            Copy the URL and decode it using a URL decoder like [urldecoder.org]. 

            ![decoder-online](/assets/img/guides/decoder-online.png)

        
            In this case `             00e2x000001AT3y            ` is your
            profile ID.
        

7.  <a name="public"></a>Get the public certificate for Salesforce. Do the following in order
    to achieve this.

    !!! info 
        For more information on generating the certificate, see the [Salesforce
        documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_keys_creating.htm&type=0).

    1.  In the left navigation panel, Expand **Security** and click
        **Certificate and Key Management** or you can search for
        Certificate and Key Management in the Quick Find search box.  

    2.  Click **Create Self-Signed Certificate**.
    3.  Enter the **Label** and a **Unique Name** and click **Save**.

## Configure email address as the username

Provisioning is the process of coordinating the creation of user
accounts, e-mail authorizations in the form of rules and roles, and
other tasks such as provisioning of resources associated with enabling
new users.

When you log into Salesforce, you normally use an email address. So, to integrate this with the Identity Server, you need to configure WSO2 IS to enable users to log in using their email addresses. In order to do that, follow the steps given below.

{! fragments/enable-email-as-username.md !}

---

## Configure Salesforce as the Identity Provider

1.  Start the WSO2 Identity Server if it is not started up already and
    log in using the email you configured in the realm as instructed in the above section.
2.  On the Management Console, navigate to **Main** > **Identity** > **Identity Providers** > **Add**.
3.  In the form that appears, provide a name for your identity provider
    by filling in the **Identity Provider Name**. You can use
    "Salesforce.com" as an example, but this can be any name you choose.
    
4.  Upload the Salesforce public certificate that you generated and
    saved in [step 5 under Configure Salesforce](#public)
    .  
    Do this by selecting **Upload IDP certificate** and clicking the
    **Choose File** button next to **Identity Provider Public
    Certificate**.

    !!! info "Why is the certificate needed?"

        The Identity Provider's public certificate is used for SSL
        communication, to verify the signed data that comes from the
        Identity Provider and to send encrypted data to the Identity
        Provider.

    ![idp-public-certificate](/assets/img/guides/idp-public-certificate.png) 

5.  Expand the **Claim Configuration** section of the form, followed by
    the **Basic Claim Configuration** section, and select **Define
    Custom Claim Dialect**.

    !!! info 
        We are adding a claim map in order to provision the users claim
        values to salesforce when outbound provisioning users to salesforce
        via WSO2 Identity Server. Here, the **Identity Provider Claim URI**
        is the claim URI in Salesforce, which maps local claim URI in WSO2
        Identity Server. Read more about [Claim
        Management](../../../guides/dialects/configure-claims/).

6.  Click **Add Claim Mapping** and add the following claims.  
    Local claims in WSO2 IS are unique URIs. These are mapped to the
    [attributes required by salesforce to create a new
    profile](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000007571&language=en_US&type=1)
. Therefore, in this step you are mapping the attributes required by
    Salesforce to a unique URI. Now, when creating a new profile/user
    WSO2 IS sends these values to the correct attribute of Salesforce.

    | Identity Provider Claim URI        | Local Claim URI                                                                |
    |------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    | UserPermissionsCallCenterAutoLogin | `               http://wso2.org/claims/telephone              `                |
    | UserPermissionsMarketingUser       | `               http://wso2.org/claims/mobile              `                   |
    | UserPermissionsOfflineUser         | `               http://wso2.org/claims/country              `                  |
    | Username                           | `               http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress              `             |

    ![add-claim-mapping](/assets/img/guides/add-claim-mapping.png) 

7.  Expand the **Advanced Claim Configuration** section.
8.  Select the Claim URI you added from the **Provisioning Claim
    Filter** dropdown and click **Add Claim**.  
    ![provisioning-claim-filter](/assets/img/guides/provisioning-claim-filter.png) 
9.  For each Claim URI, enter a default value as shown in the following
    table. The default values are used when creating the role in
    Salesforce.  
    For example, the alias, email, profile ID and all the values listed
    below are shown when a user is
    created.  
    These are sample values to help you understand better about claim
    URI and its value types.

## Add a user using SCIM.

You can also add users to Salesforce using SCIM.

Select the correct SCIM user endpoint given in **Resident** > **Inbound Provisioning Configuration** and use it in the curl command.  
    The following is a sample cURL command to add users.

```curl
curl -v -k --header "Content-Type:application/json" --user kim@wso2.com:password --data '{"schemas":     ["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],"userName”:”kim@wso2.com","password”:”test123”,”name":{"familyName”:”paul”},”emails":     [“kim@wso2.com"],"entitlements":     [{"value":"00e2x000001AT3y","display":"ChatterFreeUser"}]}' https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim2/Users  
```

You can see that the user has been created in the "Users" section in salesforce.
