# Customizing a user's profile

Each individual user has a profile that can be updated to include
various details. To do this, click **User Profile** on the **Users**
screen. Make the changes required and click **Update**.

## Add multiple profiles for a user

You can also add multiple profiles for a user. [Claim
Management](../../dialects/add-claim-mapping/) can be used to update the details that are shown in the User Profile page.

!!! note
    
    You can only add new profiles if you are connected to a JDBC
    user store. You also need to have administrator privileges.
    

Do the following in order to add new profiles.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the Management Console, click **List** under
    **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role.
3.  Click the **User Profile** link.
4.  You can add multiple profiles using the **Add New Profile** link and
    create any number of profiles for your user as long as the user is
    located in a JDBC user store.
