# Configuring Active Directory User Stores for SCIM 1.1 based Inbound Provisioning

WSO2 Identity Server can act both as a SCIM Provider and as a SCIM
consumer at the same time. You can test the WSO2 Identity Server's SCIM
Provider API as described [here]({{base_path}}/develop/scim-1.1-apis).

When the WSO2 Identity Server is connected to an external LDAP
or an Active Directory instance, they might not have these mandatory
SCIM attributes in their schema. So the option is to map the SCIM claims
to the existing attributes of the Active Directory.

Add a user with the username "john" and password "Wso2@123". Here we have to map the **userName** (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:userName` ) SCIM attribute to an existing claim in the Active Directory (e.g.:`cn` ). Furthermore, when a user is being added in SCIM, there are four more SCIM attributes being added behind the scene. Following are the SCIM attributes:

- **location** (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.location`)
- **created** (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.created`)
- **lastModified** (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.lastModified`)
- **id** (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:id`).

So we need to map these to existing Active Directory user attributes.

When mapping claims to attributes, there are few things to be considered. The SCIM claim dialect (`urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:id` ) uses String type to hold their values. So, when mapping any SCIM claim to an attribute in the Active Directory, make sure to use the attributes which are having the String type. You can find all Active Directory attributes [here](http://www.kouti.com/tables/userattributes.htm).

When a user or a group is created with SCIM, there are a set of mandatory SCIM  claim values that need to be saved along with the user or group. Some of these values are as follows.

- urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:userName
- urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.location
- urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.created
- urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.lastModified
- urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:id

    |------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | `             urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:userName            `          | `             cn            `                |
    | `             urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.location            `     | `             streetAddress            `     |
    | `             urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.created            `      | `             homePhone            `         |
    | `             urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:meta.lastModified            ` | `             pager            `             |
    | `             urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:id            `                | `             homePostalAddress            ` |


1. Log in to WSO2 Identity Server using your credentials.
2. Go to the **Main** menu in the Management Console menu andÂ click
    **List** under **Claims**.
3. Select `http://wso2.org/claims` from the list.
4. Choose the **Id** claim and click on **Edit**.  
    <!--![id-claim]({{base_path}}/assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/id-claim.png)-->
5. Change the **Mapped Attribute** value to **homePostalAddress** and
    click **Update**.  
    <!--![update-mapped-attribute]({{base_path}}/assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/update-mapped-attribute.png)-->
6. Edit the other four claims in the same way.
7. Now the basic claim mapping is done. You can now add a user using
    the following curl command.

    - Primary Userstore Command

    ``` java
    curl -v -k --user admin:admin --data "{"schemas":[],"userName":"john","password":"Wso2@123"}" --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim/Users
    ```

    - Secondary Userstore Command

    ``` java
    curl -v -k --user admin:admin --data "{"schemas":[],"userName":'wso2.com/uresh67',"password":"Wso2@123"}" --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim/Users
    ```

    Note that the user name is preceded by the domain and is within
    single quotes 'wso2.com/uresh67'. Also note that 'wso2.com' here is
    a reference to a domain name.

    In RestClient, the following header parameters must be added and the
    double quotations must be removed from the message body.

    !!! info
        Content-Type: application/json  
        Accept: \*/\*  
        Message body  
        {schemas:\[\],userName:'wso2.com/uresh67',password:Wso2@123}

    !!! info
        You need to do the claim mapping for every SCIM claim you are using
        with user operations.
