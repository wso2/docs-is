# Configure Outbound Provisioning with Google

This topic provides instructions on how to configure Google as the
Identity Provider to provision users <!--(TODO:link-to-concept)--> from WSO2 Identity Server. The
service provider in this scenario is WSO2 Identity Server(WSO2 IS). 

!!! tip "Before you begin!"
    You need to have a Google domain. Click
    [here](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/create-google-apps-domain-three-easy-steps/)
    for more information on creating the domain.

## Configure Google

In this section, you are going to create a service account using the
Google domain you created before you started this guide. 


1.  Open the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) to create a new project.

## Configure email address as the username

Provisioning is the process of coordinating the creation of user
accounts, e-mail authorizations in the form of rules and roles, and
other tasks such as provisioning of resources associated with enabling
new users.

1.  Download WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/).
2.  <a name= "email"></a>When you log into Google, you normally use an email address. So, to
    integrate this with the Identity Server, you need to configure WSO2
    IS to enable users to log in using their email addresses. In order
    to do that, follow the steps found in [Using Email Address as
    the
    Username]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-lifecycles/enable-email-as-username)
    topic.
3.  Restart WSO2 IS using the -Dsetup parameter. This parameter is required because the username and password of the admin user was updated.

    ``` curl
    sh wso2server.sh -Dsetup
    ```

Now that you are done with configuring WSO2 Identity Server to use the
email address, configure the identity provider and the service provider.

## Configure Google as the identity provider

This section includes steps on how to register Google as an Identity
Provider.

1.  Start the WSO2 Identity Server if it is not started up already, and
    log in using the email you configured for the realm configurations
    as instructed above in [step 2 of Configuring the Identity Server to
    use the email address as the
    username](#configure-email-address-as-the-username).
2.  On the Management Console, navigate to **Main** > **Identity** > **Identity Providers** > **Add**.
3.  In the form that appears, provide a name for your identity provider
    by filling in the **Identity Provider Name**, such as Google.com,
    and optionally, add a description.

4.  Expand the **Outbound Provisioning Connectors** and click
    **Google Provisioning Configuration** section.
5.  Do the following configurations for Google provisioning.

        </table>

        ![google-provisioning]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/google-provisioning.png) 
        .

    1.  Select **Enable Connector** to enable the Google connector.
    2.  Enter your Google domain name.  
        For example, in this guide, `mydomain.com` is used as the domain
        name.
    3.  Select the claim URI for the Primary Email.  
        For example, use `http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress`.
    4.  Select the claim URI for the Given name.  
        For example, use `http://wso2.org/claims/givenname`.
    5.  Select the claim URI for the family name.  
        For example, use
        `            http://wso2.org/claims/lastname           `.
    6.  Enter your service account ID as the value for the Service
        Account Email.

        ??? tip "Can't remember your service account ID?"

            Follow the steps given below:

            1.  Open the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/cloud-resource-manager)
                and click the Menu icon in the top left corner.
            2.  Click **IAM and admin \> Service accounts**.
            3.  Note the service account ID of your service account.

    7.  Attach the private key you downloaded in [step 4.e under
        Configuring Google](#configure-google) as
        the **Private Key**.
    8.  Enter the email address you created using your domain before
        starting this tutorial as the Administrator's Email.
    9.  Enter a name for your application in the Application Name field.
        It is used to help you identify requests made by this Google
        client.
    10. Enter **{UD,UN,TD,IDP}** as the value for Google Outbound
        Provisioning Pattern. This pattern is used to build the user id
        of Google domain.
    11. Enter **\_** (the underscore character) as the value for the
        Google Provisioning Separator.

    ![google-prrovisioning-config]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/google-provisioning-config.png) 

6.  Click **Register**.

## Configure WSO2 IS as the resident service provider

1.  In the **Main** menu under the **Identity** section, click
    **Resident** under **Service Providers**.
2.  Expand the **Outbound Provisioning Configuration** on the screen
    that appears.
3.  Select the Google identity provider you configured from the drop
    down and click the
    ![outbound-provisioning-icon]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/outbound-provisioning-icon.png) button.

    !!! info
        If you enable **Blocking**, Identity Server will wait for the
        response from the Identity Provider to continue.

        If you enable **Enable Rules** and **Blocking,** blocking will block
        the provisioning till the rule completely evaluates and get the
        response back to the WSO2 IdP. Afterwards, you need to enable the
        XACML policy. For more information, see [Rule-Based
        Provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-lifecycles/rule-based-provisioning/)

4.  Click **Update**.

---

## Manage users

The next step is to check if Google is configured properly with the
Identity Server. If you add a user to the Identity Server via the
management console, this user should also appear in Google too.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the Management Console, Navigate to **Main** > **Identity** > **Users and Roles** > **Add**.
2.  Click **Add New User**.
3.  Enter the username in the form of an email and enter the password.

    !!! info 
        Later on, if you want to update the user details, you
        won't be able to update the email address.

4.  Assign a role to the user.
5.  Click **Finish**.
6.  In Google, log into admin console of your domain.  
    On the left navigation pane, expand **Users** and click **Users**.
    You will see that the user you created in the Identity Server has
    been added to Google as well.

You have successfully completed the configurations to provision users
from WSO2 IS to Google.
