## Enable password reset via email

Follow the steps below to configure WSO2 Identity Server to enable password reset via email notifications.  

1.	Open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory and check whether the following listener 
    configs are in place.
    
    ```
    [event.default_listener.identity_mgt]
	priority= "50"
	enable = false
	[event.default_listener.governance_identity_mgt]
	priority= "95"
	enable = true
	[event.default_listener.governance_identity_store]
	priority= "97"
	enable = true
	```

	!!! info 
        This is already configured this way by default. You can skip this step if you have not changed this configuration previously.

3.	Sign in to the WSO2 Identity Server Management Console (`https://<HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) as an administrator. 	 

4.	On the **Main** menu of the Management Console, click **Identity > Identity Providers > Resident**.

5.  Log in to the email account you provided in the user profile of the user you created above. You will see a new email with a password reset request.
    
6.  Follow the link provided in the email to reset the password. You can
    now log in to the My Account (`https://<HOST>:<PORT>/myaccount`) application
    successfully as the user you created above using the new password.
