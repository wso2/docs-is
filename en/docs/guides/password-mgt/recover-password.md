# Password Recovery Via Email

WSO2 Identity Server enables resetting user passwords by emailing a password reset link to the userâ€™s registered email Id.

## Prerequisites

-   If you have migrated from a previous IS version, ensure that the `IdentityMgtEventListener` with the ` orderId=50 ` is set to **false** and that the Identity Listeners with ` orderId=95 ` and `orderId=97 ` are set to **true** in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml ` file.
    
    !!! Note 
        If there are no such entries for `event.default_listener.xxx` in `deployment.toml`, you can skip this configuration. 
        
    ``` toml
    [event.default_listener.identity_mgt]
    priority= "50"
    enable = false
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_mgt]
    priority= "95"
    enable = true
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_store]
    priority= "97"
    enable = true
    ```

-   [Enable the email sending configurations]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-email-sending) of the WSO2 Identity Server.

    !!! tip
        The **AccountConfirmation** template is used to send email notifications.

        You can edit and customize the email template. For more information on how to do this, see [Customizing Automated Emails]({{base_path}}/guides/tenants/customize-automated-mails/).

    !!! note
        Select **Enable reCaptcha for password recovery** to enable reCAPTCHA for password recovery via email. See [Setting Up reCAPTCHA]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-recaptcha) for more information.

5. Update the **Recovery callback URL regex** with a relavant one.

    !!! note
        The recommended **Recovery callback URL regex** to use when testing the product is `^https:\/\/localhost:9443\/.*`. However, users should modify it to meet their requirements when they deploy the product.

6.	Click **Update**.

### Enable password recovery via email globally

1.  Navigate to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`file and add the following configurations.

    !!! tip
        To avoid any configuration issues, do this before starting the WSO2 Identity Server product instance.
    

    ```toml
    [identity_mgt.password_reset_email]
    enable_password_reset_email=true      
    ```

    !!! note
        If you want to enable reCAPTCHA for password recovery via email, you can set `enable_recaptcha` true as a property of `[identity_mgt.password_reset_email]` in the `deployment.toml` file. See [Setting Up reCAPTCHA]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-recaptcha) for more information.

        ``` toml
        enable_recaptcha=true
        ```

2.  You have now successfully configured reCAPTCHA for the password recovery flow.

    now log in to the My Account (`https://<HOST>:<PORT>/myaccount`) application
    successfully as the user you created above using the new password.
