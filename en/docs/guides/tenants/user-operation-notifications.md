# Enabling Notifications for User Operations

This feature is used to notify an external endpoint once a user operation has occurred.

For example, you may want to send an email to an email address once a new user is created or the password of an existing user is changed. This can be achieved by enabling notifications for user operations.

The configuration differs based on the type of notifications you want to send to the external endpoint. The following instructions provide information on how to send an email when a user operation takes place.

## Prerequisites
You need to configure the [email sending module]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-email-sending/#configure-the-email-sender-globally) in the `deployment.toml` file.

## Add the email notification handler
To add the email notification handler onto the WSO2 IS pack:

1. Download the [Email Notification Handler](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/details/959b792a-efce-4b12-af9b-4744c650f6b2).

2. Add the downloaded `org.wso2.carbon.identity.notification.mgt.email-x.x.x.jar` file into the `<IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins` directory.

## Configure the notification management framework

Configure the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/msg-mgt.properties` file with the desired destination and template configurations.

The following is a sample configuration for sending an email to an email address on a user operation event.

For example, user operations can include profile updates, account recovery, account locking/disabling, and asking for passwords.

```
module.name.1=email
email.subscription.1=userOperation
email.subscription.userOperation.template=/home/user/Desktop/user-operation-notification-template
# (If you are using a windows machine, the path would be C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\user-operation-notification-template)
email.subscription.userOperation.subject=User operation change information
email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.1=privateMail
email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.address=receiver@gmail.com
email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.salutation=Admin privateMail
email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.subject=User operation change information to private mail
```
