# Customize Automated Emails

The WSO2 Identity Server provides the means of customizing automated emails sent to the user. This is particularly useful in the case of tenant users as they can customize their emails specifically for
users configured under the tenant. Furthermore, tenants do not have access to underlying configuration files, therefore, this customization is now possible directly through the management console.
