# Authentication - Overview

WSO2 Identity Server is an identity provider that allows you to authenticate your organization users when they log in to your applications. You can use the required authentication protocol for your applications and configure the required sign-in flow. You can also enable strong authentication using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and adaptive authentication.
