# Enable Single Sign-On for an OIDC Web Application

This page guides you through configuring [single sign-on authentication]({{base_path}}/references/concepts/single-sign-on) between two OIDC web applications. This is demonstrated using two sample applications called Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.

## Scenario

Pickup is a cab company that has two OIDC web applications called pickup-dispatch and pickup-manager. Both applications use WSO2 Identity Server (IS) as the identity provider. When SSO is configured for both these applications, a user is only required to provide their credentials to the first application and the user will be automatically logged in to the second application.

Follow the steps below to deploy the sample applications and see how this works. 

----

## Register the services providers

You need to register the two sample applications as service providers in WSO2 Identity Server.

### Pickup Dispatch
1. Log in to the Management Console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) using admin/admin credentials. 

2. Click **Service Providers** > **Add**. 

3. Enter `pickup-dispatch` as the **Service Provider Name**.
 
4. Click **Register**.
    
5. Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration** and then **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration**. 

6. Click **Configure**.   

7. Select the relevant grant types that you wish to try out from the **Allowed Grant Types** list. 
        
8.  Enter `http://wso2is.local:8080/pickup-dispatch/oauth2client` as the **Callback Url**.
    
    !!! tip
        For more information on `Callback Url` field and other advanced configurations
        refer, [Advanced OpenID Connect Configurations]({{base_path}}/guides/login/oauth-app-config-advanced)
        
9.  Click **Add**. Note that the **OAuth Client Key** and **Client Secret** get generated. You will need these values later on when deploying the sample application.

10.  Click **Update** to save the changes.

### Pickup Manager

1. Access the Management Console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`).

2. Navigate to **Main**>**Identity**>**Service Providers** and click **Add**.

3. Enter **pickup-manager** in the **Service Provider Name** text box,
    and click **Register**.

4. In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration** section.
    
5. Enter the following value as the **Callback URL**: `http://localhost.com:8080/pickup-manager/oauth2client`

    !!! Tip
        The callback URL is the service provider URL to which the authorization codes are sent. Upon successful authentication, the browser should be redirected to this URL. 

6. Click **Add**. Note the **OAuth Client Key** and **Client Secret** that is displayed. You will need these values later on when deploying the sample application.

    !!! Tip
        For more information on the advanced configurations
        refer, [Advanced OAuth/OpenID Connect Configurations]({{base_path}}/guides/login/oauth-app-config-advanced).

5.  Click **Update** to save the changes.

## Set up the samples

Let's set up and configure the sample applications:

### Pickup Dispatch


1. Download the [pickup-dispatch.war](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases/download/v4.5.0/pickup-dispatch.war) sample.

3.  Extract the `pickup-dispatch.war` file and open the `dispatch.properties` file located in the `<EXTRACT>/WEB-INF/classes` folder.

4. Replace the `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret` values with the OAuth Client Key and Client Secret values that were generated for the newly created service provider.

### Pickup Manager

1. Download the [pickup-manager.war](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases/download/v4.5.0/pickup-manager.war) sample.

2. Extract the `pickup-manager.war` file and open the `manager.properties` file located in the `<EXTRACT>/WEB-INF/classes` folder.

3. Replace the `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret` values with the OAuth Client Key and Client Secret values that were generated for the newly created service provider.

    ![pickup-key-secret-2]({{base_path}}/assets/img/fragments/pickup-key-secret-2.png)

## Deploy the samples

Next, deploy the sample web apps on a web container.

1.  Download Apache Tomcat 8.x from
[here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and install. Tomcat
server installation location will be referred as `<TOMCAT_HOME>` later
in this guide.      
    
    !!! Info
        It is recommended that you use a hostname that is not `localhost` to avoid browser errors. Modify the `/etc/hosts` entry in your machine to reflect this. Note that `wso2is.local` is used in this documentation as an example, but you must modify this when configuring the authenticators or connectors with this sample application.

4.  Next, copy the extracted and modified `pickup-manager` and `pickup-dispatch` folders to the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps` folder.

You are now ready to try out OpenID Connect SSO with the Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager sample web applications.

## Try it

Let's try SSO with the two application.

1. Navigate to `http://wso2is.local:8080/pickup-dispatch` on your browser and click **Login**.

    ![Pickup Dispatch login]({{base_path}}/assets/img/samples/dispatch-login.png)

2. You will be redirected to the login page of WSO2 IS. Log in using your WSO2 IS credentials (admin/admin). Provide the required consent.
You will be redirected to the Pickup Dispatch application home page.

3. Now, if you navigate to `http://wso2is.local:8080/pickup-manager` and click **Login**, you can see that user has been automatically logged in to this application without being prompted for user credentials.

You have successfully configured OpenID Connect single sign-on for two web applications using WSO2 IS as the identity provider.
