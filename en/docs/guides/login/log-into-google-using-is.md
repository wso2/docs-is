# Log in to Google using the Identity Server

This page guides you through using WSO2 Identity Server to log in to Google.

-----
!!! tip "Before you begin!"
    You need to have a Google domain. Click
    [here](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/create-google-apps-domain-three-easy-steps/)
    for more information on creating the domain.
-----

## Configure Google

1. Access your domain's admin console via [https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com).

2. Click **Security**.

    !!! info
        Can't see the Security section? Click the **MORE CONTROLS** bar at the bottom and you can see the Security section.

    ![more-controls](../../assets/img/guides/security-google.png)

3. Click **Set up single sign-on (SSO) with a third party IdP**.

    ![third-party-idp](../../assets/img/guides/setup-sso-google.png)

4. Enter the following URLs to your third-party Identity Provider
    (IdP).

    - **Sign-in page URL:**
        `https://<IS_HOSTNAME>:<IS_PORT>/samlsso`

    - **Sign-out page URL:**
        `https://<IS_HOSTNAME>:<IS_POST>/samlsso`

5. Upload the Identity Server certificate:  
    The certificate file must contain the public key for Google to
    verify the sign-in requests.

    1. Navigate to the
        `<IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security`
        directory via the terminal.
    2. Run the command given below to import the public certificate
        from the keystore to a `.pem` file.

        ``` java
        keytool -export -alias wso2carbon  -keystore wso2carbon.jks -storepass wso2carbon -file mycert.pem
        ```

        !!! info
            The `mycert.pem` file is created in the same directory mentioned in **step** **a** above. If you want to change the name of the file that is being generated, enter a preferred name instead of `mycert` in the above command.

    3. Click **Replace certificate** and upload the
        `.pem` file you just generated.

    4. Click **Save**.

### SAML Configurations

Make the following changes to the created service provider.

1. Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration > SAML Configuration** and click **Configure**.

2. Fill in the value for **Issuer** and **Assertion consumer URL** as shown below.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Issuer</td>
    <td><div class="content-wrapper">
    <p><code>                 google.com                </code></p>
    </div></td>
    <td>This is the <code>               &lt;saml:Issuer&gt;              </code> element that contains the unique identifier of the service provider.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Assertion Consumer URL</td>
    <td><pre><code>https://www.google.com/a/&lt;ENTER_YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;/acs</code></pre>
    <code>              </code></td>
    <td>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected to after the authentication is successful. This is the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL of the service provider. The identity provider redirects the SAML2 response to this ACS URL. However, if the SAML2 request is signed and SAML2 request contains the ACS URL, the Identity Server will honor the ACS URL of the SAML2 request.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

3. Select **Enable Response Signing** to sign the SAML2 Responses returned after the authentication process.

4. Select **Enable Attribute Profile** and **Include Attributes in the Response Always** so that the the identity provider will always include the attribute values related to the selected claims in the SAML2 attribute statement.

5. Click **Register**.

## Try it out

Now, you have successfully configured Google and WSO2 Identity Server.

!!! note
    The admin users of your Google domain do not get redirected to WSO2 IS.
    Therefore, to try out the tutorial you need to use a user who is not an
    admin in your Google account.

1. Create a user in WSO2 Identity Server. Make sure that the same user
    exists in your Google domain.  
    In this example, `alex@wso2support.com`
    is in the Google domain. Therefore, we need to create the same user in WSO2 Identity Server.

    {!fragments/create-user-email-username.md!}

2. Navigate to
    `https://google.com/a/<ENTER_YOUR_DOMAIN>/acs`
    and enter the email address (username) of the user you created.  
    You are navigated to WSO2 Identity Server's sign in screen.
3. Enter the username and password of the user you created.  
    You are navigated to the G-Suite of that domain and you can select
    the application you need to use.

  

!!! tip
    If you want to only access Gmail, navigate to
    [mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com), enter the username of the
    user, enter the username and password of the user on the WSO2 Identity
    Server sign in screen, and you are navigated to the user's mail account.
