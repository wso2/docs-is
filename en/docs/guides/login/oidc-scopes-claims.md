## Add custom claims to OIDC scope

When the existing claim mappings are not enough for your requirement and if you need to add a custom OIDC claim to a scope, then follow the steps below.

1. [Add a custom claim](../../../guides/dialects/add-claim-mapping/#add-local-claim) to the local dialect (https://wso2.org/claims)
2. [Add an external claim](../../../guides/dialects/add-claim-mapping/#add-external-claim) to the `http://wso2.org/oidc/claim` dialect referring the local claim created in step 1. 

3. Click **OIDC Scopes > List** and add the new OIDC claim under the desired scope. 

!!! tip     
    For a sample use case, see [Handling Custom OIDC Claims.](https://medium.com/identity-beyond-borders/handling-custom-claims-with-openid-connect-in-wso2-identity-server-56d3b6e4319b)

!!! Note "About oidc-scope-config.xml"
    The `oidc-scope-config.xml` file enables grouping of claims that are bound to a scope value in OpenID Connect (OIDC). 
    By default, the `oidc-scope-config.xml` file is located inside the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity` directory. 
    In the very first server start-up, the scopes and claims values defined in this file will be stored in the database. 
    Thereafter the changes made to this file will not be applicable.
