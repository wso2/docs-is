## Configure reCAPTCHA API keys

[reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) is a free widget service provided by Google that can be used for protection against spam or other forms of internet abuse by verifying whether a user is a human or a robot. The following section guides you through setting up reCAPTCHA with WSO2 Identity Server.

First, you need to register and create an API key pair for the required domain. The key pair consists of a site key and secret. The site key is used when a reCAPTCHA widget is displayed on a page. After verification, a new parameter called g-recaptcha-response appears on the form which the user submits. From the server side, you can verify the submitted captcha response by calling the Google API with the secret key.

1.  Go to <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>.

2.  Fill in the fields to register
    your identity server domain and click **Register**. The following
    are sample values:
    -   **Label:** WSO2 Identity Server
    -   Select the reCAPTCHA V2 option.
    -   **Domains:** is.wso2.com  

3.	Accept the terms of service. 

4.  Click **Submit**.

## Configure reCAPTCHA for SSO

1. Log in to the management console  (`https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/carbon`).

2. Click **Main** > **Identity** > **Identity Providers** > **Resident**.

3. Expand the **Login Attempts Security** tab. Then, expand the **reCaptcha for SSO Login** tab.

4. Select the relevant option according to your requirement:

    - **Always prompt reCaptcha:** 

        Select this option to prompt users for reCaptcha with every SSO login attempt. 

    - **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts:** 
    
        Select this option to prompt reCAPTCHA only after the number of max failed attempts exceed. 
    
        If you select this option, enter a value for the **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** field as well. For example, if you enter 3, reCaptcha will be re-enabled after 3 failed attempts.  
        
        ![configure-captcha-for-sso]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/recaptcha-sso.png)
        
        Note the following when selecting this option:
        
        - Account locking must be enabled to enable **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts**.

        - The **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** value must be lower than the **Maximum failed login attempts** value configured under the **Account Lock** tab.
    
          ![configure-account-locking]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/configure-account-locking.png)
    
5.  You have now successfully configured reCAPTCHA for the single sign
    on flow. If the number of failed attempts reaches the maximum
    configured value, the following reCAPTCHA window appears.

!!! Info
     If the user exceeds the maximum allowed failed login attempts as well, be sure to [configure email notifications for account locking]({{base_path}}/guides/tenants/email-account-locking).
