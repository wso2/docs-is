# Configure reCAPTCHA for Single Sign-On

This topic guides you through configuring reCAPTCHA for the single sign on flow. By configuring reCAPTCHA, you can mitigate or block brute force attacks.

!!! Info 
    For more information on configuring single sign-on, see [Configuring Single Sign-On]({{base_path}}/guides/login/enable-single-sign-on/).

    For more information on brute force attacks, see [Mitigating Brute Force Attacks]({{base_path}}/deploy/mitigate-attacks/mitigate-brute-force-attacks/).

You can either configure the reCAPTCHA for a tenant or configure it globally. 

## Prerequisites

[Setting Up reCAPTCHA]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-recaptcha.md) with WSO2 Identity Server.

## Configure single sign-on with reCAPTCHA for a specific tenant

1. Log in to the management console  (`https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/carbon`).

2. Click **Main** > **Identity** > **Identity Providers** > **Resident**.

3. Expand the **Login Attempts Security** tab. Then, expand the **reCaptcha for SSO Login** tab.

4. Select the relevant option according to your requirement:

    - **Always prompt reCaptcha:** 

        Select this option to prompt users for reCAPTCHA with every SSO login attempt. 

    - **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts:** 
    
        Select this option to prompt reCAPTCHA only after the number of max failed attempts exceed. 
    
        If you select this option, enter a value for the **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** field as well. For example, if you enter 3, reCAPTCHA will be re-enabled after 3 failed attempts.  
        
        ![configure-captcha-for-sso]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/recaptcha-sso.png)
        
        Note the following when selecting this option:
        
        - Account locking must be enabled to enable **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts**.

        - The **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** value must be lower than the **Maximum failed login attempts** value configured under the **Account Lock** tab.
    
          ![configure-account-locking]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/configure-account-locking.png)
    
5.  You have now successfully configured reCAPTCHA for the single sign on flow. If the number of failed attempts reaches the maximum configured value, the reCAPTCHA logo appears at the bottom right of the screen.

## Configure single sign-on with reCAPTCHA globally

1.  Navigate to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`file and add the following configurations.

    !!! tip
        To avoid any configuration issues, do this before starting
        the WSO2 Identity Server product instance.

    ```toml
    [sso_login.recaptcha]
    enabled=true
    enable_always=false
    max_attempts="3"
    ```
## Try it

Start WSO2 Identity Server and log in to the My Account (`https://<HOST>:<PORT>/myaccount`) application.

If the number of failed attempts reaches the maximum configured value, the reCAPTCHA logo appears at the bottom right of the screen.

!!! Info
     If the user exceeds the maximum allowed failed login attempts as well, be sure to [configure email notifications for account locking]({{base_path}}/guides/tenants/email-account-locking).
