# Configure Session Time Out and Remember Me

## Session time out

This is the duration in minutes for which an single sign-on (SSO) session can be idle for. If WSO2 Identity Server does not receive any SSO authentication requests for the given duration, a session time out occurs. The default value is **15 minutes**.

-----

## Remember me

This is the duration in weeks for which WSO2 Identity Server should remember an SSO session given that you have selected the Remember Me option in the WSO2 Identity Server login screen. The default value is **2 weeks**.

---

## Configuration

To configure the **Session Timeout** and **Remember Me period**  tenant wise, follow the steps below:

1.  Start the Identity Server and log in to the management console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`).

2.  Click **Resident** under **Identity Providers** on the **Main** tab.

3.  Fill in the fields as seen below to configure **Idle Session Time Out**
    and **Remember Me Period**.

    !!! Tip "Configure timeout values globally" 
        The global configuration can be added to the
        `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file as shown below. The `idle_session_timeout` property defines the session time out period. The `remember_me_session_timeout` property defines the period of time for which the WSO2 Identity Server will remember the user's SSO session.
            
        ```
        [session.timeout]
        idle_session_timeout= "15m"
        remember_me_session_timeout= "14d"
        ```
    
        Restart the server to save the changes. Once you add these global configurations, each tenant that is created after adding the configuration will inherit the same configurations.
        
!!! note 
    With every authentication, the value of `remember_me_session_timeout` is updated for each user. To disable extending this expiry time with each authentication request, add the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file. 
    
    ``` toml
    [session.timeout]
    extend_remember_me_session_timeout_on_auth=false
    ```
