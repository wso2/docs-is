# Login - Overview

You can easily integrate your applications with WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) and enable basic authentication. With this method, users who log in to your applications are prompted with the login screen of WSO2 IS where they can enter their credentials to securely log in.

See the topics in this section to enable login for different types of applications and to understand the different protocols and configurations you can use.
