# Skip User Consent

The user's [consent]({{base_path}}/references/concepts/consent-management/) is required by default for an application to access the attributes configured.

2. Navigate to the **Service Providers** tab listed under the **Identity** section and click **List**.

3. Click **Edit** adjacent to the service provider for which you want to skip the consent step.  

3. Expand **Local & Outbound Authentication Configuration**. 

4.  Enable **Skip Login consent**.
