## Configure claim mappings and requested claims

All the basic information of a user/application is stored in the form of
claims. But for the same information, different Identity Providers(IDP)
have different claims. Therefore, there should be a proper mechanism to
map those claims within Identity Providers.

Here, we are authenticating the service provider application using
facebook IDP. Therefore we need to map FaceBook claims with our WSO2 IDP
claims.

1.  In the **Identity** section under the **Main** tab, click **List**
    under **Identity Providers**.
    
2.  Click **Edit** to edit the facebook identity provider you created.

3.  Under **Claim Configuration**, go to **Basic Claim Configuration**.
    
4.  Select the **Define Custom Claim Dialect** option under **Select
    Claim mapping Dialect**.
    
5.  Click **Add Claim Mapping.** The following screen will be
    displayed.  
    ![add-claim-mapping-for-facebook](/assets/img/guides/add-claim-mapping-for-facebook.png)
    
6.  Now add custom claim mappings as follows.  
    ![custom-claim-mapping](/assets/img/guides/custom-claim-mapping.png)
    
7.  You can retrieve all the public information of the user and the
    email address. The following are some common attribute names.

    -	id  
    -	email  
    -	name  
    -	first\_name  
    -	last\_name  
    -	link  
    -	gender  
    -	locale  
    -	age\_range

    More information is available from the following link:
    <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.0>

    You can map these attributes to any **Local Claim URI** that is
    suitable.

8.  From the receiving claims, you can select one claim as the user
    identifier for that particular identity provider. You can configure
    this through **User ID Claim URI** (e.g., email).
9.  Click **Update** to save changes.

You have successfully configured facebook as your federated authenticator. Now, when you try to log in to your application, it should redirect to the Facebook login page. On successful authentication with your Facebook credentials, you will be able to access your application.
