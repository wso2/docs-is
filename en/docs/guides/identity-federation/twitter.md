    <td>This defines the name identifier formats supported by the identity provider. The service provider and identity provider usually communicate with each other regarding a specific subject. That subject should be identified through a Name-Identifier (NameID), which should be in some format so that it is easy for the other party to identify it based on the format. Name identifiers are used to provide information regarding a user.</td>

    <tr class="even">
    <td>Certificate Alias</td>
    <td>wso2carbon</td>
    <td>Select the <strong>Certificate Alias</strong> from the drop-down. This is used to validate the signature of SAML2 requests and is used to generate encryption.

    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Include Attributes in the Response Always</td>
    <td>Selected</td>
