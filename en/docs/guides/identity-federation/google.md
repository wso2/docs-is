    <code>              </code></td>
    <td>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected to after the authentication is successful. This is the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL of the service provider. The identity provider redirects the SAML2 response to this ACS URL.

    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>NameID Format</td>
    <td>The default value can be used here.</td>
    <td>This defines the name identifier formats supported by the identity provider. The service provider and identity provider usually communicate with each other regarding a specific subject. That subject should be identified through a Name-Identifier (NameID), which should be in some format so that it is easy for the other party to identify it based on the format. Name identifiers are used to provide information regarding a user.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Certificate Alias</td>
    <td>wso2carbon</td>
    <td>Select the <strong>Certificate Alias</strong> from the drop-down. This is used to validate the signature of SAML2 requests and is used to generate encryption. Basically, the service provider’s certificate must be selected here. Note that this can also be the Identity Server tenant's public certificate in a scenario where you are doing a tenant-specific configuration.</td>

    <td>Enable Attribute Profile</td>
    <td>Selected</td>
    <td>Select <strong>Enable Attribute Profile</strong> to enable this and add a claim by entering the claim link and clicking the <strong>Add Claim</strong> button. The Identity Server provides support for a basic attribute profile where the identity provider can include the user’s attributes aof the attribute statement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Include Attributes in the Response Always</td>
    <td>Selected</td>
