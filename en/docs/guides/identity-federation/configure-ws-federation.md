!!! info "Configuring hostname verification"

	In previous releases, Passive STS Single-Logout (SLO) requests for
	service providers were initiated without hostname verification which can
	impose a security risk. From IS 5.2.0 release onwards, certificate
	validation has been enforced and hostname verification is enabled by
	default. If you want to disable the hostname verification, open the `	<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml	` file and add the following configuration.

	``` xml
	[saml.slo] 
	host_name_verification: false
	```

	!!! info
	
		If the certificate is self-signed, import the service
		provider's public key to the IS client trust store to ensure that the
		SSL handshake in the SLO request is successful. For more information on
		how to do this, see [Managing Keystores with the UI](../../../deploy/security/managing-keystores-with-the-ui) in
		the WSO2 Product Administration Guide.
