# Configure OAuth2-OpenID Connect

[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an authorization framework that is
capable of providing a way for clients to access a resource with
restricted access on behalf of the resource owner. OAuth 2.0 is capable
of authorizing the flows for web applications, desktop applications, and
mobile applications among others.

OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0,
which facilitates clients to verify the end-user identity against the
authentication performed by an authorization server. At the same time,
it provides methods to transfer the end user information through claims.

With OAuth as its base, OpenID Connect allows many types of clients such
as web-based clients, mobile clients and javascript clients to verify
the users with an authorization server-based authentication.

1.  Access the Management Console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) using the `admin/admin` credentials.
    
2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu. Click
    **Add** under **Identity Providers**.  
    
3.  Fill in the details in the **Basic Information** section.

4.  Expand the **Federated Authenticators** section and then the
    **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Configuration** form.  
    ![oauth2-openid-connect-configuration](/assets/img/guides/oauth2-openid-connect-configuration.png)
        
    !!! note
        WSO2 Identity Server supports RP-initiated logout requests to OpenID Connect identity providers.
    
5.  Fill in the following fields where relevant.

    Prior to this, you need to configure an oauth application in the
    federated authorization server and get the application information
    such as client ID and secret. For example, see
    [configure OAuth2-OpenID Connect single sign-on](../../../guides/login/webapp-oidc/).

    !!! tip
        By default, the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** are stored as
        plain text values, where the **Client Secret** is generally stored
        as a random number generated using two UUIDs and HMAC-SHA1 hash
        function, which is known to resist the strongest attack known
        against HMAC.
    
        If you want to change the format in which the **Client Secret** is
        stored, open the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and add the following configuration.

        ```toml
        [oauth]
		hash_tokens_and_secrets = true 
		```

        Once you configure a required token persistence processor, be sure
        to restart the server for the changes to be applied to WSO2 Identity
        Server.

        possible values that you can specify based on your
        requirement, see [Supported token persistence
        processors](TO-DO:../../learn/extension-points-for-oauth#token-persistence-processor).-->
