If you need to make modifications to a role, use the links in the
**Actions** column on the **Roles** screen as follows:

<!--![actions-on-roles](../../../../assets/img/fragments/actions-on-roles.png) -->

-   Rename the role
-   Change the default permissions associated with this role
-   Assign this role to users
-   View the users who are assigned this role
-   Delete the role if you no longer need it  

!!! info 
    If the role is in an external userstore to which you are connected in
    read-only mode, you will be able to view the existing roles but not edit
    or delete them. However, you can still create new editable roles.
