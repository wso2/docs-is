## Configure reCAPTCHA API keys

[reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) is a free widget service provided by Google that can be used for protection against spam or other forms of internet abuse by verifying whether a user is a human or a robot. The following section guides you through setting up reCAPTCHA with WSO2 Identity Server.

First, you need to register and create an API key pair for the required domain. The key pair consists of a site key and secret. The site key is used when a reCAPTCHA widget is displayed on a page. After verification, a new parameter called g-recaptcha-response appears on the form which the user submits. From the server side, you can verify the submitted captcha response by calling the Google API with the secret key.

1.  Go to <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>.

2.  Fill in the fields to register
    your identity server domain and click **Register**. The following
    are sample values:
    -   **Label:** WSO2 Identity Server
    -   Select the reCAPTCHA V2 option.
    -   **Domains:** is.wso2.com  

3.	Accept the terms of service. 

4.  Click **Submit**.
