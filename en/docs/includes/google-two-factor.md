<!--
If you are using a Google mail account, note that Google has restricted third-party apps and less secure apps from sending emails by default. Therefore, you need to configure your account to disable this restriction, as WSO2 Identity Server acts as a third-party application when sending emails to confirm user registrations or notifications for password reset. Follow the steps given below to enable your Google mail account to provide access to third-party applications.
1.  Navigate to <https://myaccount.google.com/security>.
2.  Click **Signing in to Google** and make sure that the **2-step Verification** is disabled or off.
