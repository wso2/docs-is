1. Log in to the management console  (`https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/carbon`).

2. Click **Main** > **Identity** > **Identity Providers** > **Resident**.

3. Expand the **Login Attempts Security** tab. Then, expand the **reCaptcha for SSO Login** tab.

4. Select the relevant option according to your requirement:

    - **Always prompt reCaptcha:** 

        Select this option to prompt users for reCaptcha with every SSO login attempt. 

    - **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts:** 
    
        Select this option to prompt reCAPTCHA only after the number of max failed attempts exceed. 
    
        If you select this option, enter a value for the **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** field as well. For example, if you enter 3, reCaptcha will be re-enabled after 3 failed attempts.

        Note the following when selecting this option:
        
        - Account locking must be enabled to enable **Prompt reCaptcha after max failed attempts**.

        - The **Max failed attempts for reCaptcha** value must be lower than the **Maximum failed login attempts** value configured under the **Account Lock** tab.
    
          ![configure-account-locking](../../../../assets/img/guides/configure-account-locking.png)
    
5.  You have now successfully configured reCAPTCHA for the single sign
    on flow. If the number of failed attempts reaches the maximum
    configured value, the following reCAPTCHA window appears.
