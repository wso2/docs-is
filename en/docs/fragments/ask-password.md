    You can also configure the above configurations via the configuration
    files. 
    

    ??? note "Click to see how to configure this through the configuration files" 
        <a name="file-based-config"></a>
        Make sure the following configuration is added
        to the ` <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml ` file to set the
        confirmation URL valid time period in **minutes**.  
        The confirmation link that is provided to the user to set the
        password is invalid after the time specified here has elapsed.

        ``` toml
        [identity_mgt.user_onboarding]
        enable_email_verification = true
        verification_email_validity = "1440"
        lock_on_creation=true
        [identity_mgt] 
        email_sender= "internal"
        [identity_mgt.user_onboarding]
        ask_password_email_validity = "1440"
        password_generator = "org.wso2.carbon.user.mgt.common.DefaultPasswordGenerator"
        ```
    
    !!! info "Configure Ask Password Feature for tenants" 
        These properties can be enabled for each tenant at tenant creation by
        adding the corresponding configuration to the `
        <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file as explained in the previous section. 
            
        Optionally, you can log in to the Management Console as a tenant
        admin and change the **Resident IDP** configurations accordingly to enable this feature for a specific tenant.

5.  Additionally, if you are adding users via the management console, to
    enable "Ask password" option in the
    Management Console the following property needs to be added to the `
    <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment-toml` file.

    ``` toml
    [identity_mgt.user_onboarding]
    ask_password_from_user= true
    ```

6.  Enable the email sending configurations of the WSO2 Identity Server
    as explained here.
