!!! tip "Troubleshooting tip"

	If you are getting the following error, the sample applications do not have a keystore in them.
	Therefore, you may get this error after changing the tomcat hostname because the public key of the WSO2 Identity Server does
	not exist in the Java certificate store.

	``` java
	javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: 			sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
	```
