    ??? Note "Click to view information on using Google for email notifications"
    
        If you are using a Google mail account, note that Google has restricted third-party apps and less secure apps from 
        sending emails by default. Therefore, you need to configure your account to disable this restriction, as WSO2 
        Identity Server acts as a third-party application when sending emails to confirm user registrations or notifications 
        for password reset.     
        
        Follow the steps given below to enable your Google mail account to provide access to third-party applications.
    
        1.  Navigate to <https://myaccount.google.com/security>.
    
        2.  Click **Signing in to Google** and make sure that the **2-step Verification** is disabled or off.

        3.  Click **Less secure app access** and enable **Allow less secure apps: ON**.

2. Restart the server once configurations are in place.
