### Download the sample

To be able to deploy a WSO2 Identity Server sample, you need to download
it onto your machine first.

Follow the instructions below to download the sample from GitHub.

1. Navigate to [WSO2 Identity Server Samples](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases).

2. Download the `travelocity.com.war` file from the latest release assets.

### Deploy the sample web app

Deploy this sample web app on a web container.

1.  Copy the `travelocity.com.war`file into the `webapps` folder. For
    example, ` <TOMCAT_HOME>/apache-tomcat-<version>/webapps`
    
2.  Open a terminal window and add the following entry to the
    `/etc/hosts` file of your machine to configure
    the hostname.

    ``` bash
    127.0.0.1   wso2is.local
    127.0.0.1   localhost.com
    ```

    !!!info "Why is this step needed?"
		Some browsers do not allow you to create cookies for a naked
		hostname, such as `            localhost           `. Cookies are
		required when working with SSO . Therefore, to ensure that the SSO
		capabilities work as expected in this tutorial, you need to
		configure the `            etc/host           ` file as explained in
		this step.

		The `            etc/host           ` file is a read-only file.
		Therefore, you won't be able to edit it by opening the file via a
		text editor. Instead, edit the file using the terminal commands.  
		For example, use the following command if you are working on a
		Mac/Linux environment.

		``` java
		sudo nano /etc/hosts
		```
		
3.  Open the `travelocity.properties` file found in the `
    <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes ` directory
    and configure the following property with the hostname ( `
    wso2is.local ` ) that you configured above.

    ``` text
    #The URL of the SAML 2.0 Assertion Consumer
    SAML2.AssertionConsumerURL=http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp
    ```
    
4.  Restart the Tomcat server.

To check the sample application, navigate to
`http://<TOMCAT_HOST>:<TOMCAT_PORT>/travelocity.com/index.jsp`
on your browser.

For example,
`http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com/index.jsp`

!!! tip
    
    If you wish to change properties like the issuer ID, consumer
    URL, and IdP URL, you can edit the **travelocity.properties** file found
    in the `         travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes        ` directory.
    Also if the service provider is configured in a tenant you can use
    "QueryParams" property to send the tenant domain.For example,
    "QueryParams=tenantDomain=wso2.com".
    
    This sample uses the following default values.

    | `             SAML2.IsPassiveAuthn=true                         `                                                                                                                   | Set this to send SAML2 passive authentication requests             |
    
    If you edit the `travelocity.properties` file, restart the
    Apache Tomcat server for the changes to take effect.
