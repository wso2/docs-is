When you are using more than one userstore, you must map the attributes
correctly by [adding a claim mapping](../../../guides/dialects/add-claim-mapping/).
Under “Mapped Attribute(s)” you need to follow the pattern.

However, for the default userstore, you do not need to provide the
domain name. As an example, if you have two userstores, one is the
default and another one with domain “DEMO” then the pattern would be as
follows for “
`                   http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress                 `".

``` java
DEMO/mail
```
