# Local Transport

Apache Axis2's local transport implementation is used to make internal
service calls and transfer data within the Axis2 instance. The following
class implements the sender API:

-   `          org.apache.axis2.transport.local.LocalTransportSender         `

The transport does not have a receiver implementation as of now.

It provides an opportunity for fast in-VM service call.

To use this transport, configure an endpoints with the
`          local://         ` prefix. For example, to make an in-VM call
to the HelloService, use
`                     local://HelloService                   ` .

##### Configuring a local transport with WSO2 products

Shown below is how to configure a local transport with any WSO2
Carbon-based product.

1\. In the carbon.xml file at location \<PRODUCT\_HOME\>/repository/conf,
an endpoint is available as follows by default.

``` html/xml
<ServerURL>local://services/&lt;/ServerURL>
```

2\. In the axis2.xml file at location
\<PRODUCT\_HOME\>/repository/conf/axis2, there is a transport sender
named 'local' specified as follows:

``` html/xml
<transportSender name="local" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.local.LocalTransportSender"/>
```

It has to be replaced with the following sender/receiver pair.

``` html/xml
<transportReceiver name="local" class="org.wso2.carbon.core.transports.local.CarbonLocalTransportReceiver"/>
<transportSender name="local" class="org.wso2.carbon.core.transports.local.CarbonLocalTransportSender"/>
```
