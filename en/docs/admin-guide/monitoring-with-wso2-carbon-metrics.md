# Monitoring with WSO2 Carbon Metrics

WSO2 products based on Carbon 4.4.x Kernel versions are shipped with JVM
Metrics, which allows you to monitor statistics of your product server
using Java Metrics.Â The Java Metrics library consists of a variety of
metrics that can be used for monitoring. With the WSO2 Carbon Metrics
API, we have enabled all the metrics that are required for effectively
monitoring WSO2 products.

The following sections explain how the Carbon Metrics functionality is
used in WSO2 products:

-   [Setting Up Carbon Metrics](_Setting_Up_Carbon_Metrics_)
-   [Using JVM Metrics](_Using_JVM_Metrics_)
-   [Using Messaging Metrics](_Using_Messaging_Metrics_)
