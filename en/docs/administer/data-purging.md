# Data Purging

You can perform data purging by clearing the session data using the script given below. WSO2 Identity Server stores session data for authentication purposes. As the volume of the data stored grows over
time, the authentication operations may also eventually consume more time. You can apply data purging to mitigate this. 

!!! info 
    For more information about session persistence, see [Authentication Session Persistence](../../learn/authentication-session-persistence).

!!! tip
    It is safe to run these steps in read-only mode or during a time when traffic on the server is low.
    

1.  Take a backup of the running database.
2.  Set up the database dump in a test environment and test it for any
    issues. For more information on setting up a database dump, go to
    the
    [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#mysqldump-syntax)
   , [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server)
   , and
    [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/backup.112/e10642/rcmbckba.htm#BRADV8138)
    offical documentation.

    !!! tip
        We recommend that you test the database dump before the cleanup task as the cleanup can take some time.
    

3.  To clean the session and operation data that are stored in the `IDN_AUTH_SESSION_STORE` table, run the following script on the database dump. 

    !!! note
        This script clears session data that are older than the last 14 days and operational data that are older than the last 6 hours.

4.  Once the cleanup is over, start the WSO2 Identity Server pointing to the cleaned-up database dump and test throughly for any issues.  
    You can also schedule a cleanup task that will be automatically run after a given period of time.
