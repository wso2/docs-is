# Setting up Oracle

The following sections describe how to set up an Oracle database to
replace the default H2 database in your WSO2 product:

-   [Setting up the database and
    users](#SettingupOracle-Settingupthedatabaseandusers)
-   [Setting up the JDBC
    driver](#SettingupOracle-SettinguptheJDBCdriver)

### Setting up the database and users

Follow the steps below to set up an Oracle database.

1.  Create a new database by using the Oracle database configuration
    assistant (dbca) or manually.

2.  Make the necessary changes in the Oracle
    `           tnsnames.ora          ` and
    `           listner.ora          ` files in order to define
    addresses of the databases for establishing connections to the newly
    created database.

3.  After configuring the `           .ora          ` files, start the
    Oracle instance using the following command:

        $ sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe restart

4.  Connect to Oracle using SQL\*Plus as SYSDBA as follows:

    `           $ ./$<ORACLE_HOME>/config/scripts/sqlplus.sh sysadm/password as SYSDBA          `

5.  Connect to the instance with the username and password using the
    following command:

        $ connect

6.  As SYSDBA, create a database user and grant privileges to the user
    as shown below:

    ``` powershell
    Create user <USER_NAME> identified by password account unlock;
    grant connect to <USER_NAME>;
    grant create session, create table, create sequence, create trigger to <USER_NAME>;
    alter user <USER_NAME> quota <SPACE_QUOTA_SIZE_IN_MEGABYTES> on '<TABLE_SPACE_NAME>';
    commit;
    ```

7.  Exit from the SQL\*Plus session by executing the
    `          quit         ` command.

### Setting up the JDBC driver

1.  Copy the Oracle JDBC libraries (for example, \<
    `          ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc14.jar)         ` to the \<
    `          PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib/         `
    directory.
2.  Remove the old database driver from the
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/dropins/         `
    directory.

If you get a "
`                     timezone region not found"                   `
error when using the `          ojdbc6.jar         ` file with WSO2
servers, set the Java property as follows:
`          export JAVA_OPTS="-Duser.timezone='+05:30'"         `

The value of this property should be the GMT difference of the country.
If it is necessary to set this property permanently, define it inside
the `          wso2server.sh         ` as a new
`          JAVA_OPT         ` property.

## What's next

By default, all WSO2 products are configured to use the embedded H2
database. To configure your product with Oracle, see [Changing to
Oracle](../../administer/changing-to-oracle).
