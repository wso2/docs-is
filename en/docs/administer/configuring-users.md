# Configuring Users

User management functionality is provided by default in all WSO2
Carbon-based products and is configured in the
`         user-mgt.xml        ` file found in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/        ` directory. The
instructions given in this topic explain how you can add and manage
users from the management console.

To enable users to log into the management console, you create user
accounts and assign them roles, which are sets of permissions. You can
add individual users or import users in bulk.

### Adding a new user and assigning roles

!!! note
    
    Add the `         GetRoleListOfInternalUserSQL        ` property within
    the `         <Realm>        ` section in the
    `         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/user-mgt.xml        ` file as
    shown below, to avoid case sensitivity issues when creating users.
    
    ``` xml
    <Realm>
    <Configuration>
    <Property name="GetRoleListOfInternalUserSQL">SELECT UM_ROLE_NAME FROM UM_HYBRID_USER_ROLE, UM_HYBRID_ROLE WHERE UPPER(UM_USER_NAME)=UPPER ( ? ) AND UM_HYBRID_USER_ROLE.UM_ROLE_ID=UM_HYBRID_ROLE.UM_ID AND UM_HYBRID_USER_ROLE.UM_TENANT_ID=? AND UM_HYBRID_ROLE.UM_TENANT_ID=? AND UM_HYBRID_USER_ROLE.UM_DOMAIN_ID=(SELECT UM_DOMAIN_ID FROM UM_DOMAIN WHERE UM_TENANT_ID=? AND UM_DOMAIN_NAME=?)</Property>
    </Configuration>
    </Realm>
    ```
    

Follow the instructions below to add a new user account and configure
its role.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the management console, and click **Add**
    under **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role.  
3.  Click **Add New User**. The following screen will open:  
    ![](../../assets/img/53125498/53287370.png)
4.  Do the following:  
    1.  In the **Domain** list, specify the user store where you want to
        create this user account. This list includes the primary user
        store and any other secondary user stores that are configured
        for your product. For information on configuring user stores,
        see [Configuring User Stores](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-user-stores).
    2.  Enter a unique username and the password that the person will
        use to log in. By default, the password must be at least five
        characters and should have at least one character with a capital
        letter, characters, numbers and special characters.
    3.  Click **Next**.
5.  Optionally, select the role(s) you want this user to have. If you
    have many roles in your system, you can search for them by name.
6.  Click **Finish**.

A new user account is created with the specified roles and is listed on
the **Users** page.

### Importing users

In addition to creating users manually, user information stored in a CSV
or Excel file can be imported in bulk to a user store configured in your
WSO2 product. This possibility is only available if you have a [JDBC
user store configured for your product](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-a-jdbc-user-store)
.

Note the following before you use this feature:

-   The option to import users in bulk is enabled in your product by
    default. If not, you can enable it by adding the following property
    to the JDBC user store configured in the
    `            user-mgt.           ` xml file (stored in the
    `            <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf           ` directory).

    ``` java
    <Property name="IsBulkImportSupported">true</Property>
    ```

-   It is recommended to upload a maximum of 500,000 users at a time. If
    you need to upload more users, you can upload them in separate
    batches of 500,000 each.
-   You can also specify the size of the file that you can upload to the
    product in the
    `            <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml           `
    file using the `            TotalFileSizeLimit           `
    element as shown below. This value is in MB.

    ``` java
        <TotalFileSizeLimit>100</TotalFileSizeLimit>
    ```

#### Creating a file with users

You must first create a CSV file or an Excel file with the user
information. It is possible to import the **username** and **password**
directly from the CSV/Excel to the product. You can also assign each
user to multiple roles. Here's an example CSV file:

``` java
UserName,password,roleuser1,password123, role=admin:developer
user2,password123, role=admin:tester
user3,password123, role=admin:developer:tester
user4,password123, role=devops
user5,password123, role=devops:tester
```

!!! note
    
    Make sure you have the roles that you assign to the users available in
    the system. If not, the server will throw an error. See [Configuring
    Roles](Configuring_Roles) for information on adding user roles to the
    server.
    

In addition to importing users with their passwords and roles, you can
import other user attributes such as **email address**, **full name**,
**last name, mobile**, **given name etc.** using [claim URls that are
defined for attributes](Managing_User_Attributes). Here's an example
of claim URls that you can defined for your product:

``` java
http://wso2.org/claims/givenname
http://wso2.org/claims/lastname
http://wso2.org/claims/mobile
http://wso2.org/claims/role
```

To import users with username, password, roles, and other attributes (as
claim URls), create a CSV file as shown in the example below:

``` java
UserName,password,Claims
user1, password123,http://wso2.org/claims/givenname=myname1,http://wso2.org/claims/lastname=mylastname1,http://wso2.org/claims/mobile=077777777,http://wso2.org/claims/role=admin:developer
user2, password123,http://wso2.org/claims/givenname= myname2,http://wso2.org/claims/lastname=mylastname2,http://wso2.org/claims/mobile=077777777,http://wso2.org/claims/role=admin:devops
user3, password123,http://wso2.org/claims/givenname= myname3,http://wso2.org/claims/lastname=mylastname3,http://wso2.org/claims/mobile=077777777,http://wso2.org/claims/role=developer:devops
```

!!! note
    
    If you are using **WSO2 Identity Server**, you can choose to leave the
    password empty as shown by the third line in the below sample. To use
    this option, you need to first enable the [Ask Password
    option](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Creating+Users+Using+the+Ask+Password+Option)
    for the server.

#### Importing users from the CSV/Excel file

To import users in bulk:

1.  Log in to the management console of your WSO2 product.
2.  In the **Configure** menu, Under **Users and Roles**, click
    **Add.**  
3.  Click **Bulk Import Users**.  
4.  The user stores configured for your product will be listed in the
    **Domain** field. Select the user store to which you want to import
    the users from the list, upload the CSV or excel sheet, and click
    Finish. ![](../../assets/img/53125498/80118426.png){height="250"}

The default password of the imported users is valid only for 24 hours.
As the system administrator, you can resolve issues of expired passwords
by logging in as the Admin and changing the user's password from the
**User Management -\>** **Users** page. The 'Everyone' role will be
assigned to the users by default.

### Customizing the user's roles and permissions

Each role specifies a set of permissions that the user will have when
assigned to that role. After creating a user, you can assign and remove
roles for that user by clicking **Assign Roles** in the **Actions**
column. To see which users a role is already assigned to, click **View
Users** next to the role.  

You can also customize which permissions apply to this user by clicking
**View Roles** in the **Actions** column of the **Users** screen and
then selecting the permissions from each role that you want this user to
have. For information on permissions, see [Role-based
Permissions](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon443/Role-based+Permissions)
.

### Customizing a user's profile

Each individual user has a profile that can be updated to include
various details. To do this, click **User Profile** on the **Users**
screen. Make the changes required and click **Update**. You can also
add multiple profiles for a user.

!!! note
    
    **Note** : You can only add new profiles if you are connected to a JDBC
    user store. You also need to have administrator privileges.
    

Do the following in order to add new profiles.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the Management Console, click **List** under
    **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role.
3.  Click the **User Profile** link.
4.  You can add multiple profiles using the **Add New Profile** link and
    create any number of profiles for your user as long as the user is
    located in a JDBC user store.

### Deleting an existing user

Follow the instructions below to delete a user.

Deleting a user cannot be undone.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the management console click **List** under
    **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with **User
    Management** level permissions. For information on permissions, see
    [Role-based
    Permissions](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon443/Role-based+Permissions)
    .  
3.  In the **Users** list, click **Delete** next to the user you want to
    delete, and then click **Yes** to confirm the operation.

!!! tip
    
    Once a user is deleted, you can remove all references to the deleted
    user's identity via the [Identity Anonymization
    tool](https://github.com/wso2/identity-anonymization-tool). For
    information on building and running the tool, see [Removing References
    to Deleted User Identities in WSO2
    Products](Removing_References_to_Deleted_User_Identities_in_WSO2_Products)
    .
