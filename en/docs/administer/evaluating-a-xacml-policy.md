# Evaluating a XACML Policy

The XACML TryIt Tool allows users to test their policies easily, without
creating and sending authorization requests to Identity Server. It is a
UI tool through which authorization requests can be created and
evaluated against available policies in the system. Users can create
simple authorization requests using the web UI of the TryIt Tool. By
switching to “Create Request Using Editor” mode, you can write complex
XACML 3.0 requests in XML format and try them.

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    
    Prior to creating a basic XACML 3.0 request for evaluation you need to
    [create a policy](../../learn/creating-a-xacml-policy).
    

Follow the instructions below to create a basic XACML 3.0 request for
Evaluation. You can create a request using one of the following methods.

5.  Use the "Toggle editor" to create a request in XML. The default
    elements are as follows:

    -   `            <Resource>           `
    -   `            <Subject>           `
    -   `            <Action>           `
    -   `            <Attribute>           `
    -   `            <Attribute AttributeId>           `
    -   `            <AttributeValue/>           `
    -   `            <Environment>                       `
