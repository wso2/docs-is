# Getting WSO2 Updates

**WSO2 Updates** include any improvements (e.g., bug fixes, security
fixes) that are released by WSO2 on top of a released WSO2 product
version. With updates, you do not have to wait until the next product
version is released to get the fixes you want. Find out more about W SO2
updates at <https://wso2.com/updates> .

You can get updates using the WSO2 in-place updates tool or WSO2 Update
Manager (WUM tool). For more information, see [WSO2
Updates](https://docs.wso2.com/display/updates/Introduction).
