# WSO2 Administration Guide

Welcome to the WSO2 Administration Guide!

In this guide, you learn how toÂ configure WSO2 products that are built
on top of the WSO2 [Carbon](http://wso2.com/products/carbon/) platform
version 4.4.x. WSO2 Carbon is the base platform on which the products
are built.

See the [WSO2 release
matrix](http://wso2.com/products/carbon/release-matrix/) to identify the
products that are released for the Carbon 4.4.x platform. Once you have
configured your product, see the [product
documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/) on how to use each product.
