# System Logs

The " **System Logs** " page displays information regarding the log
files of the current product. Furthermore, it has a feature that allows
the user to view log files according to their preference. The log files
can be retrieved in two ways:

-   If syslog-ng is configured, log files are taken from the remote
    location where the log files are hosted using the syslog-ng server.
-   If syslog-ng is not configured, log files are taken from the local
    file system (super-tenant or Stand alone apps).

See [Monitoring Logs](../../administer/monitoring-logs-using-management-console-using-management-console) in the WSO2 Product Administration
Guide for more information about logging.

6.  You can filter the system logs using the **Level** drop-down. Select
    the category of logs you want to view. The available categories are:

        presumably lead the application to abort.)
    -   **ERROR** - Error messages (Error events that might still allow
        the application to continue running.)
    -   **WARN** - Warning messages (Potentially harmful situations.)
    -   **INFO** - Information messages (Informational messages that
        highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained
        level.)
    -   **DEBUG** - Debug messages (Fine-grained informational events
        that are most useful to debug an application.)
    -   **TRACE** - Trace messages (Finer-grained informational events
        than the DEBUG)
