# Introduction to Composite Applications

Any WSO2 product can have numerous artifacts such as Axis2 services,
data services, endpoints, mediators, registry resources, BPEL workflows
etc. Usually, these artifacts are created in a development environment
and then moved one by one to staging /production environments. This
manual process is time-consuming. Instead, you can bundle the
configuration files and artifacts that are in one environment to a
Composite Application (C-App) and migrate configurations across
environments by deploying the C-App in the new environments.

A C-App is a collection of artifacts deployable on different WSO2
product runtimes. Composite Application Archive (CAR) files, which have
the extension .car are used in some deployment options. A C-App and CAR
file can have multiple artifacts bundled in it but the runtime that you
choose to deploy it in deploys only the artifacts that match its server
role. For example, an ESB runtime does not deploy a data service that is
bundled in the CAR file unless the default configuration is
altered. Therefore, when you deploy a C-App or CAR in a particular WSO2
product, but all its artifacts might not be deployed in that particular
product instance.

### The structure of a C-App

A typical C-App contains individual directories for its artifacts, along
with a file named `         artifacts.xml        `, which contains
metadata about the artifacts that are inside the C-App. The diagram
below depicts the structure of a sample C-App:

Given below is a sample `         artifacts.xml        ` file:

![](../../assets/img/53125457/53287353.png)

The sample file contains the name of the C-App, its version and the
artifact type according to which the deployer for the artifact is
identified. For C-Apps, the artifact type of the sample is "
`         carbon/application"        ` . In addition, it also contains
details about the artifacts that are bundled in the CAR file. If it's an
Axis2 service, the file extension used is `         .aar        `, if
it is a web app, it is `         .war        ` etc. The artifact type
changes accordingly. For example, if it's an Axis2 service, the type is
" `         service/axis2        ` " and if it's a web app, the type is
" `         web/application        ` " or "
`         webapp/jaxws        ` ".

### What is the `         serverRole        ` property

Although a C-App can have a collection of different artifacts, the
runtime that you choose to deploy it in deploys only the artifacts that
match its `         serverRole        ` property. For example, you do
not deploy a data service to an ESB runtime. W hen a C-App is being
deployed, it reads the `         serverRole        ` property that is in
the `         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml        ` file
and deploys only the artifacts that match the
`         serverRole        ` value in the file.

Each product has a different default `         serverRoles        `
property as follows:

| WSO2 product                   | `             serverRole            ` value | Sample artifacts    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| WSO2 Application Server        | ApplicationServer                           | foo.aar, jax-wx.war |
| WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus    | EnterpriseServiceBus                        | proxy.xml           |
| WSO2 Identity Server           | IdentityServer                              |                     |
| WSO2 Data Services Server      | DataServicesServer                          |                     |
| WSO2 Governance Registry       | GovernanceRegistry                          |                     |
| WSO2 Business Activity Monitor | BusinessActivityMonitor                     |                     |
| WSO2 Business Process Server   | BusinessProcessServer                       | my\_bpel.zip        |
| WSO2 Business Rules Server     | BusinessRulesServer                         |                     |
| WSO2 Gadget Server             | GadgetServer                                |                     |

You can set the serverRole property in several ways as follows:

-   [Using the Management Console to set the serverRole
    property](#IntroductiontoCompositeApplications-UsingtheManagementConsoletosettheserverRoleproperty)
-   [Using the carbon.xml file to set the serverRole
    property](#IntroductiontoCompositeApplications-Usingthecarbon.xmlfiletosettheserverRoleproperty)
-   [Using a system property to set the serverRole
    property](#IntroductiontoCompositeApplications-UsingasystempropertytosettheserverRoleproperty)

  

#### Using the Management Console to set the `         serverRole        ` property

This is the easiest and the most recommended way to configure your
server roles.

1.  Log in to the Management Console of your product and click **Server
    Roles** in the **Configure** tab.
2.  Click **Add New Server Role**, e nter the r ole name and click
    **Add**. You can add any textual name as a server role without
    special characters except underscore.

3.  Note that the newly added server role is displayed in the list.  
    ![](../../assets/img/41255091/41517077.png) You can delete the server
    role by clicking **Delete**.

    !!! tip
    
        **Tip** : You cannot undo a deletion once performed. Users can even
        delete a default server role. Once deleted, the server role manager
        will not pick up the deleted server role from the
        `           carbon.xml          ` file, next time the server starts.
    
    
        **Tip** : The server roles that you set through the Management
        Console cannot be changed using other methods. Server roles are
        stored in the registry when they are configured through the
        Management Console. Values in the Registry are always given priority
        over others.
    

#### Using the `         carbon.        ` xml file to set the `         serverRole        ` property

Find the `         serverRoles        ` element in
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml        ` file. For
example,

``` java
<ServerRoles>
     <Role>DataServicesServer</Role>
</ServerRoles>
```

You can also set multiple server roles. For example, if you want the
server to deploy both Web services and data services, you can assign
both roles to it as follows:

``` java
<ServerRoles>
     <Role>appserver1</Role>
     <Role>dataservices1</Role>
</ServerRoles>
```

Also, ensure that the current server has capability to deploy Axis2
services and data services. When you deploy a C-App on this server, all
artifacts that have the above two server roles get deployed.

#### Using a system property to set the `         serverRole        ` property

You can use the system property `         ServerRoles        ` to
specify the server roles that can be acted by the current product
instance. When you start the server, pass the server roles as a
comma-separated list. For example,

``` java
sh wso2server.sh -DserverRoles=appserver1,dataservices1
```
