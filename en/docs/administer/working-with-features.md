# Working with Features


WSO2 has been not recommending “Feature installation” on WSO2 Identity Server for quite some time. 
Installing OSGI features on WSO2 Identity Server is not supported from the release 5.9.0. 

The alternative for the feature installation is, to build a new product by taking the respective features using maven toolchain.
