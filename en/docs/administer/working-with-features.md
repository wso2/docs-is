# Working with Features


WSO2 has been not recommending “Feature installation” on Identity Server for quite some time. 
Installing OSGI Features for Identity Server is not supported from the release 5.9.0.



Alternative for the feature installation is to build a new product, by taking the respective features using maven toolchain.
