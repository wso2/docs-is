# Configuring the Primary User Store

User management functionality is provided by default in all WSO2
Carbon-based products and is configured in the
`         user-mgt.xml        ` file found in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/        ` directory. This
documentation explains the process of setting up a primary user store
for your system.

The default User Store

The primary user store that is configured by default in every WSO2
product is a JDBC user store, which reads/writes into the internal
database of the product server. By default, the internal database is H2
(except for WSO2 IS, which uses an LDAP as the default user store). This
database is used by the Authorization Manager (for user authentication
information) as well as the User Store Manager (for defining users and
roles).

Instead of using the embedded database, you can set up a separate
repository and configure it as your primary user store. Since the user
store you want to connect to might have different schemas from the ones
available in the embedded user store, it needs to go through an
adaptation process. WSO2 products provide the following adapters, for
connecting to LDAP, Active Directory and JDBC. Thereby, these adapters
enable you to authenticate users from different types of user stores.

The `         user-mgt.xml        ` file already has sample
configurations for all of the above user stores. To enable the required
user store configuration, you must uncomment them in the code and
comment out the ones that you do not need as explained in the following
topics.
