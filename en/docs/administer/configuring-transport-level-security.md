# Configuring Transport Level Security

Given below are the various transport-level security configurations that
are required for WSO2 products. See the following topics for
instructions.

### Enabling TLS and disabling SSL support

The transport-level security protocol of the Tomcat server is configured
in the
`         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml        `
file. By default, "TLS" is configured as the SSL protocol for HTTPS
communication by setting the sslProtocol="TLS" attribute in the
`         catalina-server.xml        ` file. Specifying TLS as the SSL
protocol ensures that all TLS versions, as well as SSL protocol
versions, are supported. However, due to the [Poodle
Attack](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf), it is necessary
to make sure that only TLS protocol versions are enabled.

Note that in some WSO2 products, such as WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (ESB
profile) and WSO2 API Manager, pass-thru transports are enabled.
Therefore, to disable SSL in such products, the
`         axis2.xml        ` file stored in the
`         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/        `
directory should also be configured.

!!! info "Poodle Attack:"
    It is necessary to disable SSL in Carbon servers because of a bug (
    [Poodle Attack](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf) ) in the
    SSL protocol that could expose critical data encrypted between clients
    and servers. The Poodle Attack makes the system vulnerable by telling
    the client that the server does not support the more secure TLS
    (Transport Layer Security) protocol, and thereby forces it to connect
    via SSL. The effect of this bug can be mitigated by disabling the SSL
    protocol for your server.

#### Disabling SSL support for products with JDK 1.8

Follow the steps given below to disable SSL support for the Tomcat
layer.

1.  Open the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml         `
    file.
2.  Make a backup of the `          catalina-server.xml         `
    file and stop the product server.
3.  Find the Connector configuration corresponding to TLS (usually, this
    connector has the port set to 9443 and the
    `           sslProtocol          ` as TLS). Remove the
    `           sslProtocol="TLS"          ` attribute and replace
    it with
    `           sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"          `
    as shown below.

    ``` java
    <Connector protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
                    port="9443"
                    bindOnInit="false"
                    sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2" 
    ```

4.  Start the server.

5.  To verify that the configurations are all set correctly, download
    and run the [TestSSLServer.jar](../assets/img/53125465/53287360.jar).

    ``` java
        java -jar TestSSLServer.jar localhost 9443
    ```

    The output of the command after disabling SSL is shown below.

    ``` java
        Supported versions: TLSv1.0
        Deflate compression: no
        Supported cipher suites (ORDER IS NOT SIGNIFICANT):
          TLSv1.0
             RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
             RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
             RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
             RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
             RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
             RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
             DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
             DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
             DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
             RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
             DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
             RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
             DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
    ```

If you have enabled the PassThrough transport, do the following:

!!! note
    This is applicable for WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (ESB profile) and WSO2
    API Manager products.
    

1.  Stop the server.

2.  Open the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml          `
    file and add the specified parameter under the
    `           <transportReceiver name="https" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.passthru.PassThroughHttpSSLListener">          `
    element as well as under the
    `           <transportSender name="https" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.passthru.PassThroughHttpSSLSender">          `
    element. If you are using JDK 1.8, you can add the following
    parameter:

    ``` java
    <parameter name="HttpsProtocols">TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</parameter> 
    ```
    
    !!! info 
        -   If you are using JDK 1.6, add the following parameter:

            ``` java
                <parameter name="HttpsProtocols">TLSv1</parameter> 
            ```

        -   If you are using JDK 1.7, add the following parameter:

            ``` java
                    <parameter name="HttpsProtocols">TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</parameter> 
            ```

        -   If you are using JDK 1.8, add the following parameter:

            ``` java
                    <parameter name="HttpsProtocols">TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</parameter> 
            ```

3.  Start the server.

4.  Test the pass-through transport using the following command with the
    corresponding port:

    ``` java
        $ java -jar TestSSLServer.jar localhost 8243
    ```

### Enabling SSL protocols and ciphers in ThriftAuthenticationService

Do the following to enable SSL protocols and ciphers in the
`         ThriftAuthenticationService.        `

1.  Add the following configurations in the
    `           <CARBON_SERVER>/repository/conf/identity/thrift-authentication.xml          `
    file as sub-elements of the root `           <Server>          `
    element.

    ``` java
        <SSLEnabledProtocols>TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2</SSLEnabledProtocols
        <Ciphers>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</Ciphers>
    ```

    !!! tip
        You can also add the following additional cipher suites to
        the `           <Ciphers>          ` property if JCE Unlimited
        Strength Jurisdiction Policy is enabled in Java.
    
        ``` java
            TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384,TLS_DHE_RSA_WIT
        ```

        If you wish to remove `           TLSv1          ` or
        `           TLSv1.1          `, you can do so by removing them as
        values from the `           <SSLEnabledProtocols>          `
        property.


2.  Restart the server.

### Enabling TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2 for products with JDK 1.7

The TLS protocol is set to TLSv1.0 (by default), in WSO2 products
running on JDK 1.7. You cannot configure this using the
`         catalina        ` - `         server.        ` xml file or the
`         axis2.        ` xml file as we do with products based on JDK
1.7. Therefore, you need to enable TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 globally by
setting a system property.

1.  Download the following artifacts:
    -   [wso2-ssl-socket-factory-provider-1.0.0.jar](../assets/img/53125465/72434246.jar)
    -   [wso2-ssl-security](../assets/img/53125465/72434248)
2.  Copy the `          wso2-         ` ssl
    `          -socket-factory-provider-1.0.0.jar         ` file to the
    `          <                     PRODUCT_HOME>                    /lib/endorsed         `
    directory.
3.  Copy the `          wso2-ssl-security         ` file to the
    `          <                     PRODUCT_HOME>                    /repository/conf/         `
    directory.
4.  Open the product startup script (
    `           wso2server.sh          ` for Linux, or
    `           wso2server.bat          ` for Windows), which is stored
    in the `           <IS_HOME>/bin          ` directory.

5.  Add the following system properties to the script:

    ``` java
        -Djdk.tls.client.protocols="TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2" \
        -Djava.security.properties="$CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/wso2-ssl-security" \
    ```

6.  Start the server.

### Disabling weak ciphers

A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. When
you set the `         sslprotocol        ` of your server to TLS, the
TLS and the default ciphers get enabled without considering the strength
of the ciphers. This is a security risk as weak ciphers, also known as
EXPORT ciphers, can make your system vulnerable to attacks such as the
Logjam attack on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The Logjam attack is also
called the Man-in-the-Middle attack. It downgrades your connection's
encryption to a less-secured level (e.g., 512 bit) that can be decrypted
with sufficient processing power.

To prevent these types of security attacks, it is encouraged to disable
the weak ciphers. You can enable only the ciphers that you want the
server to support in a comma-separated list in the
`         ciphers        ` attribute. Also, if you do not add this
cipher attribute or keep it blank, the browser will support all the SSL
ciphers by JSSE. This will enable the weak ciphers.

#### Disabling weak ciphers for the Tomcat transport

1.  Open the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/                     catalina-server.xml          `
    file.
2.  Make a backup of the `          catalina-server.xml         `
    file and stop the WSO2 product server.
3.  Add the `           cipher          ` attribute to the existing
    configuration in the `           catalina-server.xml          `
    file by adding the list of ciphers that you want your server to
    support as follows:
    `           ciphers="<cipher-name>,<cipher-name>"          ` . See
    the example given below.

    ``` java
        For Tomcat version 7.0.59 and JDK version 1.7:
        ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"  
    
        For Tomcat version 7.0.59 and JDK version 1.8:
        ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
    ```

    See the list of [supported cipher suites](../../administer/supported-cipher-suites)
    .

4.  Start the server.
5.  To verify that the configurations are all set correctly, download
    and run the [TestSSLServer.jar](../assets/img/53125465/53287360.jar).

    ``` java
        $ java -jar TestSSLServer.jar localhost 9443
    ```

    !!! note
        Note the following when you run `           TestSSLServer.jar          ` :
    
        -   The "Supported cipher suites" section in the output does not
            contain any EXPORT ciphers.
    
        -   When you use the supported cipher suites listed
            [here](../../administer/supported-cipher-suites), the BEAST attack status will
            be shown as vulnerable. Note that this is a client-side
            vulnerability caused by the TLSv1 protocol. You can make the
            BEAST status protected by removing TLSv1, which will make
            clients with TLSv1 unusable. Therefore, it is recommended
            tofixed this from the client side.
    
#### Disables weak ciphers for the PassThrough transport

Remove any weak ciphers from the PassThrough transport and ensure that
the server does not accept connections using those weak ciphers. The
PassThrough transport is configured using the axis2. xml file (stored in
the `         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/        ` directory).

1.  Open the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/                     axis2.xml          `
    file.
2.  Make a backup of the `          axis2.xml         ` file and stop
    the WSO2 product server.
3.  You need to add the `           PreferredCiphers          `
    parameter under the "Transport Ins (Listeners)" section along with
    the list of relevant cipher suites.

    ``` java
    <parameter name="PreferredCiphers">TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</parameter>
    ```

4.  Start the server.
5.  Test the pass-through transport using the following command with the
    corresponding port:

    ``` java
        $ java -jar TestSSLServer.jar localhost 8243
    ```

!!! info 
    From **Firefox** 39.0 onwards, the browser does not allow to access Web
    sites that support DHE with keys less than 1023 bits (not just
    DHE\_EXPORT). 768/1024 bits are considered to be too small and
    vulnerable to attacks if the hacker has enough computing resources.

!!! tip
    To use AES-256, the Java JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy
    files need to be installed. Download them from
    [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
    
    From Java 7, you must set the
    `           jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms          ` property in the
    `           <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/java.security          ` file
    to
    `           jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048          `
    . It rejects all algorithms that have key sizes less than 2048 for MD2,
    DSA and RSA.
    
    This tip is not applicable when you are disabling weak
    ciphers in [WSO2 Identity
    Server](../../learn/using-wso2-identity-server)

  

### Changing the server name in HTTP response headers

By default, all WSO2 products pass "WSO2 Carbon Server" as the server
value in HTTP headers when sending HTTP responses. This means that
information about the WSO2 product stack will be exposed through HTTP
responses. It is recommended to change this by configuring the server
name in the catalina `         -server.        ` xml file.

1.  Open the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/                     catalina-server.xml          `
    file.
2.  Add a new server name using the `           server          `
    property (under the relevant Tomcat connector configuration):

    ``` java
    server="WSO2 Carbon Server"
    ```

See the [Security Guidelines for Production
Deployment](../../administer/security-guidelines-for-prooduction-deployment) for the
full list of security-related recommendations for WSO2 products.
