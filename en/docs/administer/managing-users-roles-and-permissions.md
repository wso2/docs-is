# Managing Users, Roles and Permissions

User management functionality is provided by default in all WSO2
Carbon-based products and is configured in the
`         user-mgt.xml        ` file found in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/        ` directory. The
following documentation explains how users, roles and permissions can be
managed using the management console of WSO2 products.

WSO2 products support the role-based authentication model where
privileges of a user are based on the role attached.  Each role is
configured with zero or more permissions. Therefore, the set of
permissions owned by a user is determined by the roles assigned to that
user. If a user has several roles assigned, their permissions are added
togethe r.

By default, all WSO2 products have the following roles configured:

-   **Admin** - Provides full access to all features and controls. By
    default, the admin user is assigned to both the **Admin** and the
    **Everyone** roles.
-   **Internal/Everyone** - Every new user is assigned to this role by
    default. It does not include any permissions.
-   **Internal/System** - This role is not visible in the Management
    Console.

More roles may be configured by default, depending on the type of
features installed in your product. For example, in WSO2 Storage Server
(which has the Cassandra feature and RSS Manager feature installed), the
following roles will also be defined by default: **Internal/Cassandra**
and **Internal/RSSManager**.

Permissions assigned to the Admin role cannot be modified.

Before you begin your configurations, note the following:

-   Only system administrators or other users with **Security** level
    permissions can add, modify and remove users and roles. For more
    information on permissions, see [Role-based
    Permissions](../../administer/role-based-permissions).
-   Your product has a primary user store where the users/roles that you
    create using the management console are stored by default. The
    default `           RegEx          ` configurations for this user
    store are as follows. `           RegEx          ` configurations
    ensure that parameters like the length of a user name/password meet
    the requirements of the user store.

    ``` java
    PasswordJavaRegEx-------- ^[\S]{5,30}$
    PasswordJavaScriptRegEx-- ^[\S]{5,30}$
    UsernameJavaRegEx-------- ^~!#$;%*+={}\\{3,30}$
    UsernameJavaScriptRegEx-- ^[\S]{3,30}$
    RolenameJavaRegEx-------- ^~!#$;%*+={}\\{3,30}$
    RolenameJavaScriptRegEx-- ^[\S]{3,30}$
    ```

    When creating users/roles, if you enter a username, password etc.
    that does not conform to the `           RegEx          `
    configurations, the system throws an exception. You can either
    change the `           RegEx          ` configuration or enter
    values that conform to the `           RegEx          ` . If
    you change the default user store or set up a secondary user store,
    configure the `           RegEx          ` accordingly under the
    user store manager configurations in
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/user-mgt.xml          `
    file.

-   The permission model of WSO2 products is hierarchical. Permissions
    can be assigned to a role in a fine-grained or a coarse-grained
    manner.
