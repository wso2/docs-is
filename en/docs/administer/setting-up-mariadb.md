# Setting up MariaDB

The following sections describe how to set up MariaDB to replace the
default H2 database in your WSO2 product

### Setting up the database and users

Follow the steps given below to set up MariaDB. See [Tested
DBMSs](https://docs.wso2.com/display/compatibility/Tested+DBMSs) for
information on the MariaDB versions that are tested with WSO2 products.

1.  Download, install and start MariaDB on your computer. See
    <https://downloads.mariadb.org/>.

    !!! info 
        You can install MariaDB standalone or as a [galera
        cluster](../../assets/img/53125509/53287445.png) for high availability.
        Database clustering is independent of WSO2 product clustering.

        For instructions on installing MariaDB on MAC OS, go to
        [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

2.  Log in to MariaDB as the root user (or any other user with database
    creation privileges).

    ``` java
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

3.  Enter the password when prompted.

    !!! info 
        In most systems, there is no default root password. Press the
        **Enter** key without typing anything if you have not changed the
        default root password.

4.  In the MySQL command prompt, create the database using the following
    command:

    ``` java
        create database regdb;
    ```

5.  Give authorization to the regadmin user as follows:

    ``` java
        GRANT ALL ON regdb.* TO regadmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "regadmin";
    ```

6.  Once you have finalized the permissions, reload all the privileges
    by executing the following command:

    ``` java
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

7.  Log out from the MySQL prompt by executing the following command:

    ``` java
        quit;
    ```

### Setting up the drivers

Download the MySQL Java connector [JAR
file](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html), and copy it
to the \< `         IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib/        `
directory.

!!! warning
    **Note** that you must  use the MySQL connector that is compatible with
    your MariaDB version. For example,
    `         mysql-connector-java-5.1.36-bi        `
    `         n.jar        ` is compatible with MariaDB version 10.0.20. See
    [Tested DBMSs](https://docs.wso2.com/display/compatibility/Tested+DBMSs)
    for information on the WSO2 products that have been tested for
    compatibility with different versions of MariaDB and MySQL connectors.
    

## What's next

By default, all WSO2 products are configured to use the embedded H2
database. To configure your product with MariaDB, see [Changing to
MariaDB](../../administer/changing-to-mariadb).
