# Packaging Artifacts into Composite Applications

After working on your artifacts using the Tooling environment, you
bundle them into Composite Applications (C-Apps) that can later be
deployed in the server. The steps below describe how to bundle your
artifacts into a C-App. When deploying via the management console, you
will need to create a Composite Application Archive (CAR) file. See
[Creating a Composite Application Archive (CAR)
file](#PackagingArtifactsintoCompositeApplications-CreatingaCompositeApplicationArchive(CAR)file)
.

Also, you can package individual artifacts into separate C-Apps as well.
See [Packaging individual artifacts into separate Composite
Applications](#PackagingArtifactsintoCompositeApplications-PackagingindividualartifactsintoseparateCompositeApplications)
.

1.  Open the Tooling interface with all the artifacts/projects that you
    created. For example, shown below is an ESB mediation sequeance
    created with ESB artifacts.

2.  Right-click the **Project Explorer** and click **New -\> Project**
    .

3.  From the window that opens, click **Composite Application Project**
    .

4.  Give a name to the **Composite Application** project and select the
    projects that you need to group into your C-App from the list of
    available projects below. For example,  
    ![](../assets/img/50521962/119114537.png) 
5.  In the **Composite Application Project POM Editor** that opens,
    under **Dependencies**, note the information for each of the
    projects you selected earlier. You can also change the project
    details here.

#### Creating a Composite Application Archive (CAR) file

To [deploy a C-App via the product's management
console](../../administer/default-ports-of-wso2-products), you will
need to first create a Composite Application Archive (CAR) file of that
C-App.

1.  To create the CAR file, do one of the following:
    -   Right-click the C-App project and select **Export Composite
        Application Project** from the pop-up menu.

OR

1.  -   Open the `            pom.xml           ` file in the
        **Composite Application Project POM Editor** and click the
        button for creating an archive in the upper-right corner.

2.  Give the location of the CAR file and the artifacts you want to
    include in it.

    !!! tip
    
        **Tip** : When you create a CAR file with artifacts, ensure that
        each artifact name is the same as the relevant artifact file name.
    

You have now exported all your project's artifacts into a single CAR
file. Next, [deploy the Composite Application in the
server](../../administer/default-ports-of-wso2-products).

!!! note
    
    Note
    
    -   In a CAR file, if a particular artifact name is different from the
        relevant artifact file name, re-deploying the CAR file fails with an
        error.
    -   If a CAR file has one or more artifacts that have a artifact name
        different from the relevant artifact file name, removing those
        artifacts from memory fails when you delete the CAR file.
    

#### Packaging individual artifacts into separate Composite Applications

You can also create separate deployable artifacts for each individual
artifact in your project. For example, suppose you created an Apache
Axis2 Service. When you right-click the Axis2 Service Project, there is
an option called **Export Project as Deployable Archive**. It creates
the relevant deployable archive in a location you specify.

see the archive file types for different app types...

Following are the deployable archives that will be generated for each
artifact type.

| **Artifact Type**            | **Archive Type**                          |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Apache Axis2 Artifact        | .aar                                      |
| Endpoint Artifact            | .xml                                      |
| Sequence Artifact            | .xml                                      |
| Proxy Service Artifact       | .xml                                      |
| Local Entry Artifact         | .xml                                      |
| Synapse Configuration        | .xml                                      |
| ESB Mediator                 | .jar                                      |
| Registry Resource            | Registry Resource with necessary metadata |
| Third Party Library Artifact | .jar (OSGI Bundle)                        |
