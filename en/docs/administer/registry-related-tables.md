# Registry Related Tables

This section lists out all the registry related tables and their
attributes in the WSO2 Identity Server database.

#### REG\_CLUSTER\_LOCK

If you are using Registry separation implementation and sharing
configuration and governance registries among cluster nodes of any WSO2

-   `REG_RATED_TIME`
-   `REG_TENANT_ID`

#### REG\_RESOURCE\_RATING

The resources in the registry can be given a rating based on a scale
1-5. Actual rating value is stored in the table `REG_RATING` and records
in this table acts as mappings to the records in `REG_RATING`.

-   `REG_USER_ID`
-   `REG_TAGGED_TIME`
-   `REG_TENANT_ID`

#### REG\_RESOURCE\_TAG

Registry resources can be tagged with a name. Actual tag name is stored
in the `REG_TAG` table. This table is mapping records with the registry
path and the records in `REG_TAG`. Following are the columns of the
table.

-   `REG_TAG_ID`

-   `REG_TENANT_ID`  

#### REG\_RESOURCE\_PROPERTY

Properties can be added for a registry resource. Actual key value pairs
of the properties are stored in `REG_PROPERTY` table. This table is
providing the mapping for the records in `REG_PROPERTY` table with the
resource registry path. Following are the columns of the table.

-   `REG_PROPERTY_ID`
-   `REG_VERSION`
-   `REG_PATH_ID`
-   `REG_RESOURCE_NAME`
-   `REG_TENANT_ID`

#### REG\_ASSOCIATION

An association can be created from any resource (or collection) on the
registry to another resource (or collection) on the registry or an
external resource which can be referred to by a URL. While the source
should be a resource existing on the registry, the destination resource
can be anything for which a URL can be given. Association has a type
associated.

eg: Document A that confirms to a standard B, You can create an
association between those two by stating A "confirms to" B, where
association name is "confirms to". The registry associations are stored
in this table.

-   `REG_ASSOCIATION_ID`
-   `REG_SOURCEPATH`
-   `REG_TARGETPATH`
-   `REG_ASSOCIATION_TYPE`
-   `REG_TENANT_ID`

#### REG\_SNAPSHOT

This table is used to create track of revisions that you create for a
specific resource. Data will be populated upon creating a revision for a
resource from the Registry Browser (Creating a checkpoint in the meta
data section of a resource). Apart from that, versioning can be done per
each change made for a resource which can be an extremely expensive
operation at runtime (especially if there are many resources that
change). By setting the `\<versionResourcesOnChange\>` parameter in
`<IS_HOME\>/repository/conf/registry.xml` to `true/false`, you can
enable/disable versioning resources on change. If it is enabled, upon
modification to a resource, a new version will be created from the
resource and also a new record is added to this table. Following are the
columns of the table.

-   `REG_SNAPSHOT_ID`
-   `REG_PATH_ID`
-   `REG_RESOURCE_NAME`
-   `REG_RESOURCE_VIDS`
-   `REG_TENANT_ID`
