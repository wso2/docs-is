# Mitigating Brute Force Attacks

The following sections describe the impact of a brute force attack and
the approaches you can use to mitigate it.

#### How can brute force attacks be harmful?

Brute force attacks are a popular mechanism to cracking passwords. It
uses automated software to generate a large number of possible guesses
to the value of the required data (in this case, to guess the password)
and works by trial and error. A brute force cracking application
proceeds through all possible combinations of legal characters in a
sequence. For example, several HTTP brute-force tools can relay requests
through many different open proxy servers. As each of the requests
appear to come from a different IP address, simply blocking the IP
address will not work against these attacks.

#### Mitigating brute force attacks

Setting up the system to prompt the password recovery process after a
few failed attempts so that the user has to provide answers to secret
questions, can mitigate this risk. However, similiar to using these
tools to guess a user's credentials, it can also be used to guess
answers to secret questions. To further mitigate this attack, you can
use the following approaches:

1.  Lock the user account after a certain number of failed attempts, for
    a period of time. For instructions on setting this up, see [User
    Account Locking and Account
    Disabling](../../learn/user-account-locking-and-account-disabling).
2.  Present a reCaptcha after a certain number of failed attempts before
    trying again. A reCaptcha can determine if the system is dealing
    with a human or an automation. For instructions on setting this up,
    see [Setting Up ReCaptcha](../../learn/setting-up-recaptcha).
