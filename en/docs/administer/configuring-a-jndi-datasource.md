# Configuring a JNDI Datasource

Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is a Java Application
Programming Interface (API) that provides naming and directory
functionality for Java software clients, to discover and look up data
and objects via a name. It helps decoupling object creation from the
object look-up. When you have registered a datasource with JNDI, others
can discover it through a JNDI look-up and use it.

When adding a datasource, to expose a RDBMS datasource as a JNDI
datasource, click **Expose as a JNDI Data Source** to display the JNDI
fields as follows:

Following are descriptions of the JNDI fields:

-   **Name** : Name of the JNDI datasource that will be visible to
    others in object look-up.
-   **Use Data Source Factory** : To make the datasource accessible from
    an external environment, you must use a datasource factory. When
    this option is selected, a reference object will be created with the
    defined datasource properties. The datasource factory will create
    the datasource instance based on the values of the reference object
    when accessing the datasource from an external environment. In the
    datasource configuration, this is set as:
    `          <jndiConfig useDataSourceFactory="true">         ` .
-   **JNDI Properties** : Properties related to the JNDI datasource
    (such as password).  
    When you select this option, set the following properties:  
    -   `            java.naming.factory.initial           ` :  Selects
        the registry service provider as the initial context.
    -   `            java.naming.provider.url           ` : Specifies
        the location of the registry when the registry is being used as
        the initial context.
