# Setting up Remote H2

The following sections describe how to set up a remote H2 database to
replace the default H2 database in your WSO2 product:

    When to use the embedded H2 database?
    
    The embedded H2 database is NOT recommended in enterprise testing and
    production environments. It has lower performance, clustering
    limitations, and can cause file corruption failures. Please use an
    industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL
    instead.
    
    However, you can use the embedded H2 database as the local registry in a
    registry mount even in enterprise testing and production environments .
    

### Setting up the remote H2 database

Follow the steps below to set up a Remote H2 database.

1.  Download and install the H2 database engine on your computer as
    follows:

    For instructions on installing, see the [H2 installation
    guide](http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html).

2.  Go to the \< `          H2_HOME>/bin         ` directory and run the
    H2 network server starting script as follows, where \<
    `          H2_HOME>         ` is the H2 installation directory:

3.  Run the H2 database server with the following commands:
    -   For Linux:  

            $ ./h2.sh

    <!-- -->

    -   For Windows:  

            $ h2.bat

    The script starts the database engine and opens a pop-up window.

4.  Click **Start Browser** to open a web browser containing a client
    application, which you use to connect to a database. If a database
    does not already exist by the name you provided in the **JDBC URL**
    text box, H2 will automatically create a database.

### Setting up the drivers

WSO2 currently ships H2 database engine version h2-1.2.140.\* and its
related H2 database driver. If you want to use a different H2 database
driver, take the following steps:

1.  Delete the following H2 database-related JAR file, which is shipped
    with WSO2 products:  
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins/h2-database-engine_1.2.140.wso2v3.jar         `
2.  Find the JAR file of the new H2 database driver (
    `           <H2_HOME>/bin/h2-*.jar          `, where
    `           <H2_HOME>          ` is the H2 installation directory)
    and copy it to your WSO2 product's
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib          `
    directory.

## What's next

Next, you need to configure your product with Embedded H2 database. For
