# Directory Structure of WSO2 Products

All WSO2 products are built on top of the Carbon platform. The directory
structure described below is the structure that is inherited by all
Carbon-based WSO2 products. However, note that each product may contain
folders and files that are specific to the product, in addition to what
is described below.

!!! tip
    `         <IS_HOME>        ` refers to the root folder of the WSO2
    product distribution. `         <PROFILE_HOME>        ` refers to the
    root directory of other profiles that are shipped as separate runtimes
    with a product.
