# Monitoring SOAP Messages

The SOAP Tracer provided by WSO2 is a tool that displays all the SOAP
messages, including the message requests and responses that goes through
your system, when serviced are invoked.

This functionality is provided by the following feature:

**Name** : WSO2 Carbon - SOAP Tracer Feature  
**Identifier** : org.wso2.carbon.soaptracer.feature.group

Note that by default this feature is turned off. You have to enable
tracing when you use it as explained in the following section. Turning
on the **SOAP Tracer** feature may impose a significant performance
overhead. This is because all the SOAP messages will always be
completely built (deferred building will not be done) and stored in the
database by WSO2 Data Services. Hence this option should be used with
caution.

### Enabling the SOAP Tracer

3.  The tracer will show the messages of the operations that were
    invoked. For example,  
    ![](../assets/img/53125408/53287301.png)  
    By using the SOAP Tracer, you can see the SOAP messages with their
    time-stamps, service name, operation invoked and the number of
    requests to the server. The most recent SOAP messages are listed at
    the top. When a particular SOAP message is selected, its "Request"
    and "Response" can be viewed.

    Note

    This tracer does not apply to operations invoked in the admin
    services. They are filtered out.

4.  If you want to find a message, fill in the Filter field with a word
    (or a part of word) in the message and click **Search**.

5.  You will see the message in the **Messages** list and its full
    description will be shown in the **Request** or **Response** text
    area. For example,  
    ![](../assets/img/53125408/53287300.png)
