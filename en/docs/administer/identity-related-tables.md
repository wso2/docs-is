# Identity Related Tables

This section lists out all the identity related tables and their
attributes in the WSO2 Identity Server database.

#### IDN\_BASE\_TABLE

This table is used to provide information related to the server setup.
It has only one column `(PRODUCT\_NAME)`, which contains a row with the
value “WSO2 Identity Server”.  

#### IDN\_OAUTH\_CONSUMER\_APPS

This table is used when adding OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration as
Inbound Authentication Configuration for a Service Provider. The
following table lists out the columns and the values they contain.

| Column           | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| CONSUMER\_KEY    | The OAuth client key                                       |
| CONSUMER\_SECRET | The OAuth client secret                                    |
| USERNAME         | The username of the user who created the application       |
| TENANT\_ID       | The tenant ID                                              |
| APP\_NAME        | The name of the service provider                           |
| OAUTH\_VERSION   | The supported OAuth version of the application             |
| CALLBACK URL     | The URL to be redirected to when authorization is complete |
| GRANT\_TYPES     | All the grant types for the application                    |

#### IDN\_OAUTH1A\_REQUEST\_TOKEN

When using OAuth 1.0a, OAuth clients need to send the consumer key,
consumer secret and scope to the OAuth service and obtain a request
token. When the Identity Server returns a request token to such a
client, it adds a record to this table. The client will then receive the
request token and the OAuth verifier. The client can send these values
back to the service and obtain the OAuth access token. Then the record
in this table will be deleted and a new row will be added to the
`IDN\_OAUTH1A\_ACCESS\_TOKEN` table. The following table lists out the
columns and a description of the values it contains.

<table>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AUTHZ_USER</td>
<td>The username of the user that authorized the request token. Once the value of this column is added, the AUTHORIZED column will be marked as true and a random number will be inserted into the OAUTH_VERIFIER column for verification purposes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### IDN\_OAUTH1A\_ACCESS\_TOKEN

When using OAuth 1.0a and receiving a OAuth 1.0a request token, the
client application can obtain the access token by authorizing the
request token. The following table lists out the columns and a

#### IDN\_OAUTH2\_AUTHORIZATION\_CODE

When a client application is used with OAuth 2 authorization code grant
type, after the authentication, the Identity Server returns the
authorization code to the client. When this occurs, a record is added to
this table. The client application can then request the OAuth access
token using the authorized code. When the access token is returned, the
record with that authorization code is deleted from this table.The
following table lists out the columns and a description of the values it
contains.

<table>
<colgroup>

####  IDN\_SCIM\_GROUP

When creating a new role in the user store,  if the
`         SCIMEnabled        ` property in the user store configuration
is set to true, the SCIM attributes for the created role are stored in
this table.  For each role that is created, there are multiple rows
stored since multiple SCIM attributes are associated with a role
(GROUP). The following table lists out the columns and a description of

-   `TOKEN\_CONTENT`
-   `CREATE\_DATE`
-   `EXPIRE\_DATE`

#### IDN\_IDENTITY\_USER\_DATA

When using a JDBC user store, the user attributes of a user are stored
in the `UM\_USER\_ATTRIBUTE` table for the supported claims. There are
some claims used for Identity Management features that should be handled
specifically. Claims used for Identity Management feature will be stored
in the userstore which is specified in the
`         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/security/identity-mgt.properties        `
file. In that property file, the property
`         Identity.Mgt.User.Data.Store        ` is used to define what
kind of store it uses to store those reserved claims. Upon updating the
user profile, these claims and their mapped attribute values will be
inserted to this table.  

!!! note
    -   If you specify
        `           org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.store.UserStoreBasedIdentityDataStore          `
        for the `           Identity.Mgt.User.Data.Store          ` property
        which is the default store, it will use the same user store where
        the user resides for storing these special attributes.
    
    -   If you specify
        `           org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.store.JDBCIdentityDataStore          `
        for the `           Identity.Mgt.User.Data.Store          `
        property, it will not use the user's user store and will instead use
        Identity Server's internal JDBC database to store those claims.
    

  
  
The reserved claims are as follows:

-   Any claim that contains the part : `http://wso2.org/claims/challengeQuestion` for its claim URI
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/challengeQuestion1`
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/challengeQuestion2`
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/challengeQuestionUris`

-   Any claim that contains part `http://wso2.org/claims/identity` for its claim URI
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/identity/accountLocked`
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/identity/failedLoginAttempts`
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/identity/unlockTime`
    -  `http://wso2.org/claims/identity/passwordTimestamp`

The following table lists out the columns and a description of the

#### IDN\_THRIFT\_SESSION

This table is used to store the authenticated Thrift session. Once the
user is authenticated to the thrift authenticator, it creates a thrift
session. This is mainly used in the XACML feature in WSO2 Identity
Server. The **Entitlement Service** of the Identity Server is exposed
via **Thrift** transport and in order to access this admin service, it
must be authenticated. The following table lists out the columns and a
description of the values it contains.
