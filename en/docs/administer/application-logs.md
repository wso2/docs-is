# Application Logs

Events invoked by an application or a program running in a system are
recorded as application logs. Similarly, the a pplication logs of a
running Carbon instance displays the log events of its deployed web
applications and web services. The **Application Logs** page has been
introduced as a fine-grained view of system logs. While system logs
display log events of the entire system holistically, the application
logs page allows you to view the logs relevant to a particular
application.

Follow the instructions given below to access statistics on application
logs:

1.  Log on to the product's management console and select **Monitor -\>
    Application Logs**.  
2.  The "Application Logs" page appears. This page displays logs of a
    selected application in a bottom-up manner.

3.  You can see a drop-down list from which a deployed web services or a
    web applications can be selected to view its log files.

4.  In the **View** list, select the category of logs you want to view.
    The available categories are:  

    -   **TRACE** - Trace messages.
    -   **DEBUG** - Debug messages.
    -   **INFO** - Information messages.
    -   **WARN** - Warning messages.
    -   **ERROR** - Error messages.
    -   **FATAL** - Fatal error messages.
    -   **ALL** - Displays all categories of logs.  

    For Example,

    ![Log category](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/log-category.png)

5.  You can also find a certain log using the search function. Enter a
    keyword (or part of a keyword) and click **Search**. When a search
    criterion is given, the value in the **View** field is displayed as
    **Custom**. For example,  
    ![Search application logs](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/search-application-logs.png)
