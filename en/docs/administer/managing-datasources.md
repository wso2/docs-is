# Managing Datasources

A datasource provides information that a server can use to connect to a
database. Datasource management is provided by the following feature in
the WSO2 feature repository:

Name : WSO2 Carbon - datasource management feature  
Identifier: org.wso2.carbon.datasource.feature.group

If datasource management capability is not included in your product by
default, add it by installing the above feature, using the instructions
given under the Feature Management section of this documentation.

Click **Data Sources** on the **Configure** tab of the product's
management console to view, edit, and delete the datasources in your
product instance.

You can view, edit, and delete the datasources in your product instance
by clicking **Data Sources** on the **Configure** tab of the product
management console. However, you cannot edit or delete the
default \<WSO2\_CARBON\_DB\> datasource.
