# Managing User Attributes

For user and role management in WSO2 products, it is important to
understand how to manage the attributes of users within it. In the
products, each user store attribute can be mapped as a claim. Therefore,
you need to use the claim management functionality available in the
product and properly map your LDAP/AD/JDBC user store attributes with
the claim URIs defined by the product. You can also add different claim
URIs and manage them using claim management.

The following topics provide instructions on how to manage user
attributes in WSO2 products.

### Managing the attributes of a user

The following are the three main ways to view, add, edit and delete
attributes of a user in the product.

1.  By accessing the profile of the user and changing the attributes
    using the Management Console.
    1.  Log into the product's Management Console.
    2.  On the **Configure** tab in the Management Console, click
        **Users and Roles**.  
    3.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the
        Admin role.
    4.  From the list of users that appear in the resulting page,
        identify the user whose attributes you want to modify and click
        **User Profile**.

    5.  Click **Update** to save changes to the attributes.
2.  You can use the `           RemoteUserStoreManagerService          `
    API. This is a SOAP-based API and is very easy to use. Supposing you
    want to set a user attribute, you can call the following method.

    ``` java
    setUserClaimValue("username", "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress", "asela@soasecurity.org", null)
    ```

    Here “ http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress ” is the claim URI that
    has been mapped with the user store’s email attribute. The last
    parameter is profile, we can just pass “null”, as there is only one
    profile. You can retrieve the user attribute value as follows.

    ``` java
        getUserClaimValue("username", "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress", null)
    ```

3.  You can use the REST Web service according to the SCIM provisioning
    specification.

### Claim mapping when using multiple user stores

When you are using more than one user store, you must map the attributes
correctly using claim management. Under “Mapped Attribute(s)” you need
to follow the pattern.

``` java
{domain_name/attribute_Name};{domain_name/attribute_Name}; {domain_name/attribute_Name};
```

However, for the default user store, you do not need to provide the
domain name. As an example, if you have two user stores, one is default
and other one with domain “LDAP” then the pattern would be as follows
for “
`                   http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress                 `
".

``` java
email;LDAP/mail
```

### Attributes with multiple values

If your user store supports having multiple values for attributes, the
WSO2 product can view, add, update or delete them (normally LDAP/AD
offer support for this). The following are the different ways you can do
this.

1.  In the product's Management Console, multiple attribute values are
    separated by comma. If you want to update two email addresses using
    the user profile UI, you must provide it as follows.

    ``` java
        asela@soasecurity.com,aselapathberiya@soasecurity.com
    ```

    See the following screen for how this will look in the user
    interface of the product's Management Console.  
    ![](../../assets/img/43997703/44195175.png)

2.  When using the `           RemoteUserStoreManagerService          `
    API, call it as follows.

    ``` java
        setUserClaimValue("username", "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress", "asela@soasecurity.org,aselapathberiya@gmail.com", null)
    ```

    The GET results are returned in the form of comma separated values
    for the attribute.

    ``` java
        "asela@soasecurity.org,aselapathberiya@gmail.com"
    ```

    The following screen shows how this looks in the LDAP.

### Writing custom attributes

Supposing the attributes of a user are stored in both the user store
(LDAP) and another location (JDBC table), the product needs to
retrieve/add the user’s attribute in both these places. In scenarios
like this, some customization must be done. To customize this, you can
simply extend the current user store manager implementation and write a
custom implementation to do it. In the custom user store implementation,
you only need to extend the following three methods that help to
retrieve/add a user attribute. Other methods can be kept as they are.

-   Method 1.

    ``` java
        public Map<String, String> getUserPropertyValues(String userName, String[] propertyNames, String profileName) throws UserStoreException
    ```

-   Method 2.

    ``` java
        protected abstract void doSetUserClaimValue(String userName, String claimURI, String claimValue, String profileName) throws UserStoreException;
    ```

-   Method 3.

    ``` java
        protected abstract void doSetUserClaimValues(String userName, Map<String, String> claims, String profileName) throws UserStoreException;
    ```

### Authentication using multiple attributes

In a user store, each user has different attributes such as uid, cn,
email and so on. Some of the attributes can be unique. As an example,
normally **uid** and **mail** can be unique attributes for user.

Once you connect your LDAP with an application, the application can use
one of the unique attributes in LDAP to authenticate the user (as the
user name of the user in that application). Considering our example, it
can be the **uid** or **mail** attribute. Additionally, in some cases,
the application can use both attributes. So end users can be
authenticated in the application using both their **uid** or **mail**.

WSO2 products can be deployed with any LDAP based server and it can
expose authentication via a Web Service API, SAML, OAuth, OpenID, etc.
By default, WSO2 products configured to authenticate with only one user
attribute in the LDAP. This topic provides instructions on how the
products can be extended to authenticate users using more than one
attribute.

For the purposes of this example, we assume that users need to be
authenticated using both their **uid** and **mail** attributes in the
LDAP.

1.  Configure the LDAP user store related configurations using the
    **user-mgt.xml** file found in the
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf         ` directory.
    1.  Configure `            UserNameSearchFilter           ` that
        helps to search for the user object in the LDAP using both
        **mail** and **uid** attributes.  
        `            <Property name="UserNameSearchFilter">(&amp;(objectClass=person)(|(mail=?)(uid=?)))</Property>           `
    2.  Disable `            UserDNPattern           ` property, if it
        is currently enabled.  
        `            <!--Property name="UserDNPattern">uid={0},ou=Users,dc=wso2,dc=org</Property-->           `
    3.  The mail attribute has requirements that are unique. If you are
        using the mail attribute, you need to open the **carbon.xml**
        file found in the
        `            <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf           `
        directory and uncomment the following.  
        `            <EnableEmailUserName>true</EnableEmailUserName>           `
2.  If you want to work with multiple attributes (basically to retrieve
    internal roles with multiple attributes), you must add following
    property in the
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/user-mgt.xml          `
    file.  
    `           <Property name="MultipleAttributeEnable">true</Property>          `

3.  To test this, restart the product and try to log in to
    the Management Console by providing both the mail and uid with the
    same password.

### Customizing the claim for the user attribute

If you are using multiple attribute authentication and want to customize
the claim to be used for user name attribute, do the following.

Edit the following element in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/security/application-authentication.xml        `
file.

``` xml
<AuthenticatorConfig name="BasicAuthenticator" enabled="true">
    <Parameter name="UserNameAttributeClaimUri">http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress</Parameter>
</AuthenticatorConfig>
```

This will return the email address of the authenticated user. It can be
configured to return any attribute by changing the '
`         UserNameAttributeClaimUri        ` ' parameter.
