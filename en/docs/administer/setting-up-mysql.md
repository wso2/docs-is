# Setting up MySQL

The following sections describe how to set up a MySQL database to
replace the default H2 database in your WSO2 product:

-   [Setting up the database and
    users](#SettingupMySQL-Settingupthedatabaseandusers)
-   [Setting up the drivers](#SettingupMySQL-Settingupthedrivers)
-   [Executing db scripts on MySQL
    database](#SettingupMySQL-ExecutingdbscriptsonMySQLdatabase)

### Setting up the database and users

Follow the steps below to set up a MySQL database:

1.  Download and install MySQL on your computer using the following
    command:

    For instructions on installing MySQL on MAC OS, go to
    [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

      

    ``` java
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
    ```

2.  Start the MySQL service using the following command:

    ``` java
        sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
    ```

3.  Log in to the MySQL client as the root user (or any other user with
    database creation privileges).

    ``` java
        mysql -u root -p
    ```

4.  Enter the password when prompted.

    In most systems, there is no default root password. Press the
    **Enter** key without typing anything if you have not changed the
    default root password.

5.  In the MySQL command prompt, create the database using the following
    command:

    ``` java
        create database regdb;
    ```

      

    For users of Microsoft Windows, when creating the database in MySQL,
    it is important to specify the character set as latin1. Failure to
    do this may result in an error (error code: 1709) when starting your
    cluster. This error occurs in certain versions of MySQL (5.6.x), and
    is related to the UTF-8 encoding. MySQL originally used the latin1
    character set by default, which stored characters in a 2-byte
    sequence. However, in recent versions, MySQL defaults to UTF-8 to be
    friendlier to international users. Hence, you must use latin1 as the
    character set as indicated below in the database creation commands
    to avoid this problem. Note that this may result in issues with
    non-latin characters (like Hebrew, Japanese, etc.). The database
    creation command should be as follows:

        mysql> create database <DATABASE_NAME> character set latin1;

    For users of other operating systems, the standard database creation
    commands will suffice. For these operating systems, the database
    creation command should be as follows:.

        mysql> create database <DATABASE_NAME>;

6.  Give authorization to the regadmin user as follows:

    ``` java
        GRANT ALL ON regdb.* TO regadmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "regadmin";
    ```

7.  Once you have finalized the permissions, reload all the privileges
    by executing the following command:

    ``` java
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

8.  Log out from the MySQL prompt by executing the following command:

    ``` java
        quit;
    ```

### Setting up the drivers

Download the MySQL Java connector [JAR
file](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html), and copy it
to the \< `         PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib/        `
directory.

!!! tip
    
    Be sure to use the connector version that is supported by the MySQL
    version you use. If you come across any issues due to version
    incompatibility, follow the steps below:
    
    1.  Shut down the server and remove all existing connectors from
        `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib         ` and
        `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/dropins         ` .
    2.  Download the connector JAR that is compatible with your current
        MySQL version.
    3.  Copy the JAR file **only to**
        `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib         ` .
        Files will be copied automatically to the dropins folder during
        server startup.
    4.  Start the server with the - `          Dsetup         ` parameter as
        `          sh wso2server.sh -Dsetup         ` .
    

### Executing db scripts on MySQL database

To run the database script against the database you created, login to
the MySQL client and point to the corresponsing database.

``` java
use regdb;
```

Execute the mysql.sql database script against the pointed database using
following command.

``` java
mysql> source <path to the script>\mysql.sql;
```

!!! note
    
    If you are using MySQL 5.7 or later version, use mysql5.7.sql script and
    execute the above command modified as following.
    
    ``` java
    mysql> source <path to the script>\mysql5.7.sql;
    ```
    

##  What's next

By default, all WSO2 products are configured to use the embedded H2
database. To configure your product with MySQL, see [Changing to
MySQL](../../administer/changing-to-mysql).
