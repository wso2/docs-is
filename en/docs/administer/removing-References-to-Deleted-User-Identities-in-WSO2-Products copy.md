# Removing References to Deleted User Identities in WSO2 Products

When it comes to data protection in enterprise systems, a key
requirement outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is
the right of the data subject to be forgotten, which gives users the
right to request an organization to remove their personal data when
requested.

To comply with the GDPR *right to be forgotten* requirement, all
products in the [WSO2 platform](https://wso2.com/platform) support
removing references to personally identifiable information (PII) of a
user when a user is deleted from the system. You can use the [Identity
Anonymization
tool](https://github.com/wso2/identity-anonymization-tool.git) to
remove references to a user’s PII that can generally be stored in
metadata database tables, access logs, audit logs as well as any other
log files in any WSO2 product.  
The tool is designed to replace all references to a deleted user's
identity with either a randomly generated UUID value, or a pseudonym
that you specify when you run the tool.

Note

The following WSO2 products have the Identity Anonymization tool
packaged in the product distribution by default. Therefore, if you are
using any of the following products, see the relevant product
documentation page for product specific instructions on how to run the
tool.

WSO2 also supports extending this tool to include additional modules
from which you would want to remove deleted user identities. For
information on how to extend the tool, see [Extending the Identity
Anonymization Tool](../../administer/extending-the-identity-anonymization-tool).

The following topics walk you through the process of building the tool
and configuring the appropriate files and directories so that you can
run the tool in standalone mode to successfully remove references to a
deleted user's identity from one or more WSO2 products.

    Prerequisites
    
    -   [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Apache
        Maven.
    

### Building the Identity Anonymization tool

Follow the steps below to build the tool:

1.  Clone the <https://github.com/wso2/identity-anonymization-tool>
    repository to a required location.
2.  In the source that you checked out, navigate to
    `          identity-anonymization-tool         `, and run
    `          mvn clean install         ` . This downloads all
    dependencies and builds the tool in your local repository. You can
    find the
    `          org.wso2.carbon.privacy.forgetme.tool-SNAPSHOT.zip         `
    file created in the
    `          identity-anonymization-tool/components/org.wso2.carbon.privacy.forgetme.tool/target         `
    directory.
3.  Unzip the
    `           org.wso2.carbon.privacy.forgetme.tool-SNAPSHOT.zip          `
    file. This creates the
    `           identity-anonymization-tool-SNAPSHOT          `
    directory with a directory. The path to the
    `           identity-anonymization-tool-SNAPSHOT          `
    directory will be referred to as `           <TOOL_HOME>          `
    throughout this section.

    The following table describes the purpose of the most important
    configuration related directories and files of the tool, which are
    in the `           <TOOL_HOME>/conf          ` directory:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Directory/File name</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><code>               config.json              </code></td>
    <td>This is the master configuration file.<br />
    You can configure this file depending on the metadata database tables, access logs, audit logs, or any other log files on which you want the Identity Anonymization tool to run. For information on how to configure this file, see <a href="#RemovingReferencestoDeletedUserIdentitiesinWSO2Products-MasterConfig">Configuring the master configuration file</a> .</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><code>               datasources              </code></td>
    <td><p>This is the default directory where configured datasources are searched for when you run the Identity Anonymization tool.<br />
    If necessary, you can define your own datasource configurations depending on the databases that you want to connect to, and specify the defined datasource configuration location using command line arguments.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><code>               log-config/patterns.xml              </code></td>
    <td>This file should contain all the regex patterns that can be used to find and replace references to deleted user identities in log file entries.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><code>               sql              </code></td>
    <td>This directory should include all the SQL files that contain required queries to replace or delete references to deleted user identities.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

### Configuring the master configuration file

The master configuration file of the Identity Anonymization tool is the
`         config.json        ` file. Following is a sample config.json
file:

``` java
{
  "processors" : [
    "log-file", "rdbms"
  ],
  "directories": [
    {
      "dir": "log-config",
      "type": "log-file",
      "processor" : "log-file",
      "log-file-path" : "logs",
      "log-file-name-regex" : "wso2carbon.log"
    },
    {
      "dir": "sql",
      "type": "rdbms",
      "processor" : "rdbms"
    }
  ],
  "extensions": [
    {
      "dir": "datasources",
      "type": "datasource",
      "processor" : "rdbms",
      "properties" : [
        {"identity": "WSO2_CARBON_DB"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can configure the following in the `         config.json        `
file based on your requirement:

-   `          processors         ` - A list of processors on which you
    want the tool run. The processors that you can specify are
    pre-defined. Possible values are `          RDBMS         ` and
    `          log-file         ` .
-   `          directories         ` - The definitions of directories on
    which you want the tool to run. When you specify a directory
    definition, be sure to either specify the directory path relative to
    the location of the `          config.json         ` file, or
    specify the absolute path to the directory.
-   `          processor         ` - The type of processor to use to
    process instructions in the corresponding directory.
-   `          extensions         ` - The extensions to be initialized
    prior to starting a processor.

### Running the tool

Navigate to the `         <TOOL_HOME>/bin        ` directory, and
execute one of the following commands depending on your operating
system:

-   On Linux/Mac OS: `          ./forgetme.sh -U <username>         `
-   On Windows: `          forgetme.bat -U <username>         `  
      

Note

The commands specified above use only the
`           -U <username>          ` option, which is the only mandatory
option to run the tool. There are several other optional command line
options that you can specify based on your requirement. The supported
options are described in detail below.

Following are details of all possible command line options that you can
use when you run the tool:

Let's say you run the tool to replace all references to a particular deleted user’s identity, and then you add the same user back to the system for some reason, and later you want to delete the user again and replace all references to the user with the same pseudonym that was used the first time. To do this you need to specify a pseudonym when you run the tool the first time and ensure that you use that same pseudonym when you run the tool the second time.<br />

When you specify the required command line options and run the tool, it
generates relevant execution reports with the
`         Report-<PROCESSOR>-<TIMESTAMP>.txt        ` naming convention
in your current working directory.
