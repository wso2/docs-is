The WSO2 Identity Server enables you to send automated emails to users.
You can also [customize these automated emails](../../learn/customizing-automated-emails) sent to the user.

1.  Log in to the WSO2 Identity Server management console using your
    tenant credentials.
2.  Under the **Configure** menu of the management console, click **Email Templates**.
3.  In the resulting screen, you can customize the email templates that
    are sent to the users in your tenant.

    -   **Select Email Template Type** : You can select the type of
        email template you wish to customize using this dropdown.

    -   **Subject** : This is the subject of the email that is sent to
        the user.
    -   **Email Body** : This is the body of the email that is sent to
        the user. Custom information like
        `             {first-name}            ` and
        `             {user-id}            ` are populated from the user
        store configured for this tenant.
    -   **Email Footer** : This is the footer of the email.

        !!! note
            Ensure that you do not use the `|` character in your **Subject**, **Email Body**, or **Email Footer** as this is not supported.         

4.  Click **Save** to save your changes.
