# System Statistics

The **System Statistics** page shows certain statistics related to the
WSO2 Identity Server instance. These include free memory, request count,
server name, server start time, system up time, active services, total
memory, average response time, minimum response time, and maximum
response time.

!!! tip "Before you begin"
