# Mitigating Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks trick you to send a malicious
request, by forcing you to execute unwanted actions on an already
authenticated web browser.

For information on howÂ CSRF attacks can be harmful, and how you can
mitigate CSRF attacks when you use WSO2 products, see [Mitigating Cross
Site Request Forgery
Attacks](../../admin-guide/mitigating-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks.md)
in the WSO2 product administration guide.
