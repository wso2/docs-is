# Role-based Permissions

The **User Management** module in WSO2 products enable role-based
access. With this functionality, the permissions enabled for a
particular role determines what that user can do using the management
console of a WSO2 product. Permissions can be granted to a role at two
levels:

-   **Super tenant level:** A role with super tenant permissions is used
    for managing all the tenants in the system and also for managing the
    key features in the system, which are applicable to all the tenants.
-   **Tenant level:** A role with tenant level permissions is only
    applicable to individual tenant spaces.

The permissions navigator that you use to enable permissions for a role
is divided into these two categories (**Super Admin** permissions and
**Admin** permissions) as shown below. However, note that there may be
other categories of permissions enabled for a WSO2 product, depending on
the type of features that are installed in the product.

You can access the permissions navigator for a particular role by
clicking **Permissions** as shown below.

By default, every WSO2 product comes with the following User, Role and
Permissions configured:

-   The **Admin** user and **Admin** role is defined and linked to each
    other in the `           user-mgt.xml          ` file, stored in the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/          ` directory as
    shown below.

    ``` java
    <AddAdmin>true</AddAdmin>
    <AdminRole>admin</AdminRole>
    <AdminUser>
         <UserName>admin</UserName>
         <Password>admin</Password>
    </AdminUser>
    ```

-   The **Admin** role has all the permissions in the system enabled by
    default. Therefore, this is a super tenant, with all permissions
    enabled.

You will be able to log in to the management console of the product with
the **Admin** user defined in the `         user-mgt.xml        ` file.
You can then create new users and roles and configure permissions for
the roles using the management console. However, note that you cannot
modify the permissions of the **Admin** role. The possibility of
managing users, roles and permissions is granted by the **User
Management** permission. 


### Description of role-based permissions

!!! note
    Note that the descriptions given in this document only explains how
    permissions control access to operations available on the management
    console.
    

The descriptions of permissions in the **Permissions** navigator are as
follows:

-   The **Login** permission defined under **Admin** permissions allows
    users to log in to the management console of the product. Therefore,
    this is the primary permission required for using the management
    console.
    
-   The following table describes the permissions at **Super Tenant**
    level. These are also referred to as **Super Admin** permissions.
