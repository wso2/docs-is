# View and Download Logs

It is possible to monitor system logs and application logs in your
server using the management console, if the [Logging Management
feature](../../administer/monitoring-logs-using-management-console) is installed .
Further, when you monitor system logs, you can also download the
archived log files using the management console. See [Configuring Log4j
Properties](Configuring-Log4j-Properties) and [Configuring Log
Providers](Configuring-the-Log-Provider) for details on how the server
can be configured for log monitoring.

The log files can be retrieved in two ways:

-   If syslog-ng is configured, log files are taken from the remote
    location where the log files are hosted using syslog-ng server.
-   If syslog-ng is not configured, log files are taken from the local
    file system (super-tenant or Stand-alone apps).

The location of the log files on disk is specified in the
`          log4j.configuration         ` file.

The log messages displayed on this page are obtained from a memory
appender. Therefore, the severity (log level) of the displayed log
messages are equal to or higher than the threshold of the memory
appender. For more information on appenders, loggers, their log levels
and logging, go to
[http://logging.apache.org/log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/).

### View and download system logs

The **System Logs** page on the management console displays all events
of a running Carbon instance. Further, it facilitates downloading and
viewing log files according to user preferences. Follow the instructions
below to access statistics on system logs:

1.  Log on to the product's management console and select **Monitor -\>
    System Logs**. The **System Logs** page appears and displays logs
    in a bottom-up manner.

2.  To view old archived logs, click **Show archived logs** tab at the
    bottom of the **System Logs** page.

    The **Download** link can be used to download the log files. For
    example, if the server is configured to use the [default log
    provider](Configuring-the-Log-Provider), the "wso2carbon.log"
    file stored in the
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/logs/          ` directory can
    be downloaded.

3.  In the **View** list, select the category of logs you want to view.
    The available categories are:

    -   **TRACE** - Trace messages.
    -   **DEBUG** - Debug messages.
    -   **INFO** - Information messages.
    -   **WARN** - Warning messages.
    -   **ERROR** - Error messages.
    -   **FATAL** - Fatal error messages.

### View application logs

Events invoked by an application or a program running in a system are
recorded as application logs. Similarly, the a pplication logs of a
running Carbon instance displays the log events of its deployed web
applications and web services. The **Application Logs** page has been
introduced as a fine-grained view of System Logs . While system logs
display log events of the entire system holistically, the application
logs page allows you to view the logs relevant to a particular
application.

Follow the instructions given below to access statistics on application
logs:

1.  Log on to the product's management console and select **Monitor -\>
    Application Logs**.  
2.  The "Application Logs" page appears. This page displays logs of a
    selected application in a bottom-up manner.

3.  You can see a drop-down list from which a deployed web services or a
    web applications can be selected to view its log files.

4.  In the **View** list, select the category of logs you want to view.
    The available categories are:  

    -   **TRACE** - Trace messages.
    -   **DEBUG** - Debug messages.
    -   **INFO** - Information messages.
    -   **WARN** - Warning messages.
    -   **ERROR** - Error messages.
    -   **FATAL** - Fatal error messages.
    -   **ALL** - Displays all categories of logs.  

    For Example,

5.  You can also find a certain log using the search function. Enter a
    keyword (or part of a keyword) and click **Search**. When a search
    criterion is given, the value in the **View** field is displayed as
    **Custom**. For example,
