# Masking Sensitive Information in Logs

There can be business sensitive information that are added to logs in 
the product console and/or Carbon log files. When these logs
are analyzed, the information is exposed to those who check this.

To avoid this potential security pitfall, users can mask sensitive
information from the log file at the time of logging. In this feature,
you can define patterns that need to be masked from the logs. This is
particularly useful in the case of credit card numbers, access tokens,
etc.

To configure this feature, follow the instructions below.

### Enabling log masking

1.  Log masking is by default enabled in WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0.However, you need 
    to configure required masking patterns.

2.  These patterns are configured in the `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/wso2-log-masking.properties`. You can change 
    its default configurations in `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`.

### The masking pattern file

The masking pattern file is a property file that can contain one or more
masking patterns.The following is a sample configuration that showcases
how to mask the credit card numbers from the logs.

Navigate to `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`. Add the following configuration.

```toml
[masking_pattern.properties]
"CREDIT_CARD_VISA" = "4[0-9]{6,}$"
"CREDIT_CARD_MASTER" = "(?:5[1-5][0-9]{2}|222[1-9]|22[3-9][0-9]|2[3-6][0-9]{2}|27[01][0-9]|2720)[0-9]{12}"
"CREDIT_CARD_AMEX" = "[34|37][0-9]{14}$"
```

With this configuration, each log line is checked for all the configured
patterns. If any match is found, it is masked with `*****`.

!!! note 
    
    There can be a performance impact when using this
    feature with many masking patterns since each log line is matched with
    each of the patterns. So it is highly advisable to only use the most
    necessary patterns.
