# Configuring the Tenant Loading Policy

In WSO2 products based on Carbon 4.4.0 or later versions, you have the
option of setting the required tenant loading policy by enabling either
**Lazy Loading** or **Eager Loading** of tenants. Additionally, you can
separately control the loading policy for web applications and axis2
services deployed in your tenants using the **GhostDeployment** setting.

!!! note
    
    By default, **Lazy Loading** is enabled for tenants in all WSO2
    products.
    

First, read the following descriptions to understand how Lazy loading
and Eager loading work:

-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading of tenants ensures that all tenants
    are not loaded at the time the server starts. Instead, the tenants
    are loaded on demand (upon a request sent to a particular tenant).
    When a tenant receives a request, the particular tenant and all
    tenant-specific artifacts, except **web applications** and **axis2
    services**, get loaded. Therefore, if you have these artifacts (web
    applications and axis2 services) deployed in your tenants, you will
    need to separately enable lazy loading for artifacts using the
    `          GhostDeployment         ` setting. If lazy loading is not
    enabled for artifacts, by default, these artifacts will comply with
    the Eager loading behavior that is explained below.  
      
    Tenants (including the tenant-specific artifacts) are **unloaded**
    from memory if the tenant remains idle for a specified amount of
    time. You can configure the allowed tenant idle time. See
    [Configuring Lazy
    Loading](#configuring-lazy-loading)
    for instructions.  
      
-   **Eager Loading:** Unlike lazy loading, eager loading ensures that
    tenants will be initialized when the server starts (without any
    delays). You can switch to eager loading if required. Note that you
    also have the option of enabling eager loading for specific tenants
    so that only the required tenants will be loaded when the server
    starts. If you have **web applications** and **axis2 services**
    deployed for your tenants, you will want these artifacts to behave
    according to the eager loading policy. Therefore, it is recommended
    that you disable lazy loading for artifacts (
    `          GhostDeployment         ` setting) when eager loading is
    enabled.  
      
    When eager loading is enabled, tenants (and the tenant-specific
    artifacts) are expected to remain in memory without unloading until
    the server shuts down. However, due to a [known
    issue](https://wso2.org/jira/browse/CARBON-15215) in the system,
    tenants (and the tenant-specific artifacts) will unload from the
    system if the tenants are idle for more than 30 minutes. You can
    overcome this condition by applying a system property to change the
    allowed tenant idle time. See [Configuring Eager
    Loading](#configuring-eager-loading)
    for instructions.  

Now, see the instructions given below to configure the required tenant
loading policy for your system. 

### Configuring Lazy Loading

As explained above, Lazy Loading (for tenants) is enabled as the loading
policy in WSO2 products, by default. To verify that lazy loading is
enabled, open the `         carbon.        ` xml file (stored in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf        ` directory) and see
that `         <LazyLoading>        ` is uncommented as shown below.

``` java
<Tenant>
         <LoadingPolicy>
            <LazyLoading>
                    <IdleTime>30</IdleTime>
             </LazyLoading>
         <!--<EagerLoading>
                    <Include>*,!foo.com,!bar.com</Include>
             </EagerLoading>-->
        </LoadingPolicy>
</Tenant>
```

#### Enabling lazy loading of artifacts (web applications and axis2 services)

If you have lazy loading enabled, and if you have web applications and
axis2 services deployed as artifacts in your tenants, you need to
separately enable lazy loading for artifacts. This will ensure that
these artifacts are first loaded in ghost form. The actual artifacts are
deployed only when the artifact is requested.

!!! note
    
    **Before you enable lazy loading of artifacts**, note the following:
    
    -   This setting is only applicable to the following artifacts: web
        applications and axis2 services.
    -   This setting only applies if the artifacts (web applications and
        axis2 services) are using the HTTP/S transport. However, sometimes
        your axis2 services may be using other transport types such as JMS.
        In such situations, it is not recommended to enable lazy loading for
        your artifacts.
    -   When this setting is enabled for PaaS deployments, lazy loading
        applies for tenants as well as the tenant artifacts. As a result,
        for a tenant in a cloud environment, lazy loading is applicable on
        both levels.
    -   Also, if an artifact has not been utilized for a certain period of
        time ( [tenant idle
        time](#ConfiguringtheTenantLoadingPolicy-Configuringthetenantunloadingtime(forLazyLoading))
        ), it will be unloaded from memory.
    

Follow the steps given below.

1.  Open the `           carbon.xml          ` file (stored in the
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf          ` directory).

    ``` java
    <GhostDeployment>
       <Enabled>false</Enabled>
    </GhostDeployment>
    ```

2.  Set the `          <Enabled>         ` property to
    `          true         ` .

#### Configuring the tenant unloading time (for Lazy Loading)

If you have Lazy loading enabled, you can configure the allowed tenant
idle time. For example, if you set the idle time to 30 minutes, tenants
that are idle for more than 30 minutes will be unloaded automatically in
your system. You can configure this value using two methods.

-   Specify the tenant idle time when you configure the tenant loading
    policy:
    1.  Open the `             carbon.xml            ` file.

    2.  Be sure that the `            <LazyLoading>           `
        element is enabled and `            <EagerLoading>           `
        is commented out as per the default setting.
    3.  Set the tenant idle time using the
        `             <IdleTime>            ` element as shown below.  

        ``` java
        <Tenant>
                 <LoadingPolicy>
                     <LazyLoading>
                            <IdleTime>30</IdleTime>
                     </LazyLoading>-->
                 <!--<EagerLoading>
                            <Include>*,!foo.com,!bar.com</Include>
                     </EagerLoading>-->
                </LoadingPolicy>
        </Tenant>
        ```

-   Alternatively, you can specify the tenant idle time when you start
    the server:

    1.  Open the product startup script (.
        `            /wso2server.sh           ` file for Linux and
        `            wso2server.bat           ` for Windows), which is
        stored in the `            <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin           `
        directory.
    2.  Add the following system property.

        ``` java
        $JAVA_OPTS \ 
             -Dtenant.idle.time=<value_in_minutes>. \
        ```

    3.  Restart the server.

### Configuring Eager Loading

Follow the instructions given below to change the tenant loading policy
to eager loading.

!!! note **Before you enable eager loading**, note the following:
    
    -   Web applications and axis2 services that are deployed as artifacts
        in your tenants follow the eager loading behavior by default unless
        the `          GhostDeployment         ` setting is enabled, as
        explained above under [Enabling lazy loading of
        artifacts](#ConfiguringtheTenantLoadingPolicy-Enablinglazyloadingofartifacts(webapplicationsandaxis2services))
        . Therefore, when you enable eager loading for your tenants, make
        sure that `          GhostDeployment         ` is disabled.
    -   The server startup time may increase depending on the number of
        tenants and artifacts you have.
    -   The server's memory footprint will increase depending on the number
        of tenants and artifacts that are loaded.
    

1.  Open the `           carbon.xml          ` file from the
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/          ` directory.

2.  Enable the `           <EagerLoading>          ` element and comment
    out `           <LazyLoading>          ` as shown below.  

    ``` java
    <Tenant>
             <LoadingPolicy>
             <!--<LazyLoading>
                        <IdleTime>30</IdleTime>
                 </LazyLoading>-->
                 <EagerLoading>
                        <Include>*,!foo.com,!bar.com</Include>
                 </EagerLoading>
            </LoadingPolicy>
    </Tenant>
    ```

3.  You can then list the specific tenant domains to which eager loading
    should apply, by using the `          <Include>         ` element.
    See the following examples:
    -   If the setting should apply to all tenants, add `           `
        `            <Include>*</Include>           ` .
    -   If the setting should apply to all tenants, except
        [foo.com](http://foo.com/) and [bar.com](http://bar.com/), add
        `            <Include>            *,!                         foo.com                       ,!                         bar.com                        </Include>.           `
    -   If the setting should apply only to [foo.com](http://foo.com/)
        and [bar.com](http://bar.com/), add
        `            <Include>                         foo.com                       ,                         bar.com                        </Include>           `
        .

Due to a [known issue](https://wso2.org/jira/browse/CARBON-15215), when
eager loading is enabled, tenants will be unloaded from memory if the
tenant remains idle for more than 30 minutes. This issues will be
resolved in the Carbon 4.5.0 release. In current product releases, you
have the option of changing the allowed idle time (which is 30 minutes,
by default) using a system property:

1.  Open the product startup script (.
    `           /wso2server.sh          ` file for Linux and
    `           wso2server.bat          ` for Windows), which is stored
    in the `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin          ` directory.
2.  Add the following system property.

    ``` java
    $JAVA_OPTS \ 
         -Dtenant.idle.time=<value_in_minutes> \
    ```

3.  Restart the server.
