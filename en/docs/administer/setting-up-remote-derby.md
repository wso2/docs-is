-   [Setting up the
    database](#SettingupRemoteDerby-Settingupthedatabase)
-   [Setting up the drivers](#SettingupRemoteDerby-Settingupthedrivers)

### Setting up the database

Follow the steps below to set up a remote DerbyÂ database.

1.  Download [Apache
    Derby](http://apache.mesi.com.ar/db/derby/db-derby-10.8.2.2/).
2.  Install Apache Derby on your computer.

    For instructions on installing Apache Derby, see the [Apache Derby
    documentation](http://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/).

3.  Go to the `          <DERBY_HOME>/bin         ` / directory and run
    the Derby network server start script. Usually, it is named
    `          startNetworkServer         ` .

### Setting up the drivers

Copy the `         derby.jar        `,
`         derbyclient.jar        ` JAR and the
`         derbynet.jar        ` JAR from the \<
`         DERBY_HOME>/lib/        ` directory to the \<
`         PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/extensions/        `
directory (the classpath of the Carbon web application).
