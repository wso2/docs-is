# Setting up Embedded H2

The following sections describe how to set up an embedded H2 database to
replace the default H2 database in your WSO2 product:

-   [Setting up the database](#SettingupEmbeddedH2-Settingupthedatabase)
-   [Setting up the drivers](#SettingupEmbeddedH2-Settingupthedrivers)

!!! warning
    
    H2 is not recommended in production
    
    The embedded H2 database is NOT recommended in enterprise testing and
    production environments. It has lower performance, clustering
    limitations, and can cause file corruption failures. Please use an
    industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL
    instead.
    
    You can use the embedded H2 database in development environments and as
    the local registry in a registry mount.
    

### Setting up the database

Download and install the H2 database engine on your computer.

For instructions on installing DB2 Express-C, see [H2 installation
guide.](http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html)

### Setting up the drivers

WSO2 currently ships H2 database engine version h2-1.2.140.\* and its
related H2 database driver. If you want to use a different H2 database
driver, take the following steps:

1.  Delete the following H2 database-related JAR file, which is shipped
    with WSO2 products:  
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins/h2-database-engine_1.2.140.wso2v3.jar         `
2.  Find the JAR file of the new H2 database driver (
    `           <H2_HOME>/bin/h2-*.jar          `, where
    `           <H2_HOME>          ` is the H2 installation directory)
    and copy it to your WSO2 product's
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib/          `
    directory.

## What's next

Next, you need to configure your product with Embedded H2 database. For
