# Configuring WSO2 Identity Server as the Key Manager in WSO2 API Manager

The **Key Manager** component of the WSO2 API Manager handles all
clients, security and access token-related operations. The WSO2 Identity
Server can be used to play that role and act as the Key Manager in your
deployment.

To configure WSO2Â Identity Server as the Key Manager of the API Manager,
see [Configuring WSO2 Identity Server as a Key
Manager](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/Configuring+WSO2+Identity+Server+as+a+Key+Manager)
