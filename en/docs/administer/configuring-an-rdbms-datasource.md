# Configuring an RDBMS Datasource

When adding a datasource, if you select RDBMS as the datasource type,
the following screen appears:

This is the default RDBMS datasource configuration provided by WSO2. You
can also write your own RDBMS configuration by selecting the custom
datasource option. Enter values for the following fields when using the
default RDBMS datasource configuration:

-   **Data Source Type** : RDBMS
-   **Name** : Name of the datasource (must be a unique value)
-   **Data Source Provider** : Specify the datasource provider.
-   **Driver** : The class name of the JDBC driver to use. Make sure to
    copy the JDBC driver relevant to the database engine to the
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib/         `
    directory. For example, if you are using MySQL, specify
    `          com.mysql.jdbc.Driver         ` as the driver and copy
    `          mysql-connector-java-5.XX-bin.jar         ` file to this
    directory. If you do not copy the driver to this directory when you
    create the datasource, you will get an exception similar to
    `          Cannot load JDBC driver class com.mysql.jdbc.Driver         `
    .
-   **URL** : The connection URL to pass to the JDBC driver to establish
    the connection.
-   **User Name** : The connection user name that will be passed to the
    JDBC driver to establish the connection.
-   **Password** : The connection password that will be passedÂ to the
    JDBC driver to establish the connection.
-   **Expose as a JNDI Data Souce** : Allows you to specify the JNDI
    datasource.
-   **Data Source Configuration Parameters** : Allows you to specify the
    datasource connection pool parameters when creating a RDBMS
    datasource.

For more details on datasource configuration parameters, see
[ApacheTomcat JDBC Connection Pool
guide](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html).

After creating datasources, they appear on the **Data Sources** page.
You can edit and delete them as needed by clicking **Edit** or
**Delete** links.
