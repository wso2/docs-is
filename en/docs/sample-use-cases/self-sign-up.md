# Self Sign-Up

Follow the instructions given here to try out user self sign-up.

## Problem Scenario

Cameron realizes that allowing new employees to self sign-up to the Pickup web applications can speed up
the onboarding process. As a result, Cameron sets self sign-up for Pickup HR
using WSO2 Identity Server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, do the following:

1.  [Install WSO2 Identity Server]({{base_path}}/sample-use-cases/set-up/).
2.  [Enable the email sending configurations]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-email-sending) of WSO2 IS.
3.  Restart the WSO2 IS.

## Run the sample scenario

First, let's set up and run the sample applications.

1.  Follow the instructions on [setting up the samples]({{base_path}}/sample-use-cases/sample-scenario/#set-up-the-sample-apps).

    !!! info
        A message appears to pick a scenario.
    
    ![List of scenarios in QSG]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get-started/qsg-configure-sso.png)

2.  Enter `5` as the scenario number at the command prompt.

    A prompt appears to choose the user sign-up approach.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>**Enable self user registration (without any config)**</th>
            <td>
                This enables self sign-up without having to do additional configurations. Once registered, the user receives an email to the provided email address.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>**Enable account lock on creation**</th>
            <td>
                This locks the user account during user registration. The user can only sign in to the application after clicking the verification link sent to the user-provided email address. A confirmation mail is sent to the user but the user account is locked until the user confirms the account by clicking on the account confirmation mail sent by WSO2 Identity Server.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/get-started/qsg-configure-self-sign-up.png" width="600" alt="Self sign-up approaches"/>
    
3.  Enter the `number` that matches the approach you would like to try.
