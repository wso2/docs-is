|CentOS | `/usr/lib64/IdentityServer/<IS_HOME>`           |

## Configure the server

Open the `deployment.toml` file (stored in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` folder) and add the following configuration to enable CORS:

``` toml
[cors]

supported_methods = [
    "POST",
    "HEAD",
    "OPTIONS"
]
supports_credentials = false

```
