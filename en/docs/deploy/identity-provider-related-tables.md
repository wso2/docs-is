#### IDP_ROLE

An Identity Provider may have different roles for authorization which
are different from the local roles of the Identity Server. In such a
situation, roles at the Identity Provider can be mapped to the local

is the ID of the Identity Provider. Following are the columns of the
table.

-   `ID`

-   `TENANT_ID`
-   `ROLE`

---

#### IDP_ROLE_MAPPING

The mappings of local roles of the Identity Server to the roles of
Identity Providers are stored in this table. `LOCAL_ROLE` column has the
value of the role name of the local role. `IDP_ROLE_ID` column has the
ID of the Identity Provider’s role which points to the ID column of the
`IDP_ROLE` table.

-   `ID`
-   `IDP_ROLE_ID`
-   `TENANT_ID`
-   `USER_STORE_ID`
-   `LOCAL_ROLE`

#### IDP_CLAIM

When an Identity Provider is having claims that are different from the
local claims of the Identity Server, corresponding claims of the
Identity Provider can be mapped to the local claims where the Identity
Provider claims are stored in this table. The mapping details of the

is stored in this table. The Identity Provider’s ID is given in the
`IDP_ID` column which points to the ID column of the IDP. Provisioning
Connector Type is given in the `PROVISIONING_CONNECTOR_TYPE` column.
Detailed configuration for each type of provisioning connector is stored
in `IDP_PROV_CONFIG_PROPERTY` table. Following are the columns of this

#### IDP_PROV_CONFIG_PROPERTY

The properties for each Provisioning Connector are stored in this table
as key value pairs in `PROPERTY_KEY` and `PROPERTY_VALUE` columns

Connector in `IDP_PROVISIONING_CONFIG` table. Data type of the property
is stored in `PROPERTY_TYPE` column. Following are the columns of the
