# Deploy WSO2 Identity Server on Kubernetes Using Docker Desktop 

## Prerequisites

Install the following applications if you do not have them installed already. Make sure you install the recommended versions for a seamless deployment. 

1.  Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 

2.  Install [Helm](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) and [Tiller](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-tiller) **version 2.8.2**.

3.  Install [Kubernetes Client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) **version-v1.10**. 

4.  Set up a [kubernetes cluster](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on docker desktop, if you do not have one set up already. 

	!!! important ""
		1.	Click on the Docker desktop icon, ![docker](/assets/img/deploy/deploy-wso2-using/docker-desktop.png) on your notification panel. 
		Next, click **Preferences > Kubernetes > Enable Kubernetes**.  

		2.	Set the resources in such a way that you do not face any space related issues while testing the deployment. 
			a. For this, click on the Docker desktop icon, ![docker](/assets/img/deploy/deploy-wso2-using/docker-desktop.png) on your notification panel. 
			b. Next, click **Preferences > Resources**. Set the CPUs to 4 and memory to 4.00 GB.  
		

5.  Install [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) **version-nginx-0.22.0**. You can get the raw file for the recommended version [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.22.0).

6.  Add the WSO2 Helm chart repository.

	```java
	helm repo add wso2 https://helm.wso2.com && helm repo update
	```

Once you have kubernetes running on docker, follow the steps given below to deploy WSO2 Identity Server in your local environment. 

!!! note ""
-	The local copy of the `wso2/kubernetes-is` git repository will be referred to as `KUBERNETES_HOME`.
-	`<KUBERNETES_HOME>/advanced/` will be referred to as `HELM_HOME`.

---

## Step 1 - Clone the Kubernetes Resources from the WSO2 Identity Server git repository

```java
git clone https://github.com/wso2/kubernetes-is.git
```

---

## Step 2 - Change the configurations as required 

1.	The default configurations work well for the basic deployment of the product. However, if there is anything specific that needs to be configured, change the respective files in `<HELM_HOME>/is-pattern-1/`. 

2.	 Open `<HELM_HOME>/is-pattern-1/values.yaml` and provide the values as mentioned in the second step **(Provide configurations)** of the **Quick Start Guide** [here](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/wso2/is-pattern-1).

---

## Step 3 - Deploy WSO2 Identity Server

Execute the following command to deploy the product. Here, `NAMESPACE` is the Kubernetes Namespace in which the resources are deployed and the `<RELEASE_NAME>` can be any name that you choose for the deployed instance. 

```java
helm install --dep-up --name <RELEASE_NAME> <HELM_HOME>/is-pattern-1 --namespace <NAMESPACE>
```

---

## Step 4 - Access the management console

To access the console in the environment,

1.	Obtain the external IP of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses as shown below. 

	```java
	kubectl get ing -n <NAMESPACE>
	```
	This gives you the `<RELEASE_NAME>` and `<EXTERNAL-IP>` as shown below. 

	```java 
	NAME                       HOSTS                  ADDRESS        PORTS     AGE
	wso2is-ingress             <RELEASE_NAME>         <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   3m
	```

2.	Add the information obtained above in the /etc/hosts file as an entry. 

	```java
	<EXTERNAL-IP>	<RELEASE_NAME>
	```

3.	Navigate to `https://<RELEASE_NAME>/carbon` on a new browser window.

## Try it out 

You can now test the functionalities of WSO2 Identity Server with your app. You can alternatively choose a sample app from [here](../../../quick-starts/overview) and follow the steps given to deploy the chosen application. 

Make sure you add the proxy port configuration to `<KUBERNETES_HOME>/advanced/is-pattern-1/values.yaml`. 

```toml
[transport.http.properties]
proxyPort = 80
[transport.https.properties]
proxyPort = 443
```

!!! important 
	The host name has to be changed in the URLs related to the identity provider based on the `<RELEASE_NAME>` you chose in [step-3](#step-3-deploy-wso2-identity-server). This configuration is present in the properties file in `<SAMPLE_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes` where`<SAMPLE_HOME>` refers to the sample application that you have chosen to verify this deployment.
