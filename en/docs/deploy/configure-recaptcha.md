# reCAPTCHA

[reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) (v3 and v2) is a free widget service provided by Google that can be used for protection against spam or other forms of internet abuse by verifying whether a user is a human or a robot. 

-   The invisible reCAPTCHA v2 is invoked when the user clicks on an existing button. Only the most suspicious traffic will be prompted to solve a captcha.
-   The reCAPTCHA v3 does not require user interaction, and the user's actions are rated by the Google API by a score. 

!!! Note  
    -   For reCAPTCHA v3, you need to determine a threshold value for the score by looking at the traffic at [reCAPTCHA admin console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).
    -   In the current  implementation, if the  score is less than the threshold, the user request will be blocked by the server.

The following section guides you through setting up reCAPTCHA with WSO2 Identity Server.


## Configure reCAPTCHA API keys

First, you need to register and create an API key pair for the required domain. The key pair consists of a site key and secret key. The site key is used to invoke reCAPTCHA on a page. A new parameter called g-recaptcha-response is embedded to the request when user submits. From the server side, you can verify the submitted captcha response by calling the Google API with the secret key.

1.  Go to <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>.

2.  Fill in the fields to register
    your identity server domain and click **Register**. The following
    are sample values:
    -   **Label:** WSO2 Identity Server
    -   Select either invisible reCAPTCHA V2 or reCAPTCHA V3 option.
    -   **Domains:** is.wso2.com  

3.	Accept the terms of service. 

4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  Take note of the site key and secret that you receive.

## Configure reCAPTCHA in WSO2 IS

1. Open the `deployment.toml` file located in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/` directory and uncomment the following configuration 
   block to Google reCAPTCHA settings. The values copied when configuring reCAPTCHA API keys should be added for the `site_key` and `secret_key` properties. 

    ```toml
    [recaptcha]
    enabled = "true"
    api_url = "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js"
    verify_url = "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
    site_key = ""
    secret_key = ""
    ```

    !!! note
        If you are using reCAPTCHA v3, you can set a custom `threshold` value for  score. It should be value between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.5.

        ``` toml
        threshold="0.5"
        ```
    
    !!! note
    
        If you have additional authorization endpoints, you need to include
        the `login.do` URL paths of these endpoints. Here,
        URL paths are the URLs without the host parameters. The URL paths should be comma seperated. The `redirect_urls`
        should be added as a property of `[recaptcha]` in the deployment.toml file.
    
        ``` toml
        redirect_urls="url1_path,url2_path"
        ```
    
        Below is an example of how to include the URL paths of additional authorization end points.
    
        ``` toml
        redirect_urls="/authenticationendpointone/login.do,/authenticationendpointtwo/login.do"
        ```
        
2. Restart the WSO2 IS server.
