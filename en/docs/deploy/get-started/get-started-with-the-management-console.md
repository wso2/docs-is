# Get Started with the Management Console

The WSO2 Identity Server Management Console is a web-based user
interface. It allows users to interact with a running identity server
instance, without having to intervene with any underlying
configuration files. The controls in the Management Console are usually
self-explanatory. This page provides an overview of the user interface of the 
management console. 

!!! Info 
    You can access the management console of the WSO2 Identity
    server at `https://<server-host>:<server-port>/carbon`. When the server
    is [running]({{base_path}}/deploy/get-started/run-the-product) in your local setup:
            
    ```
    https://localhost:9443/carbon
    ```

    The default credentials for an administrative user is as follows. It is a
    must that you change this administrator credentials in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
    
    ```java
    username = admin
    password = admin
    ```

The following screen depicts the home screen of the management console.

home screen. Each of these menus carry a list of sub menus. These menus and subsections will 
navigate you via different configurations and features. The usable features for each

features that you can use. These are divided among the following menu items.
