# Backup and Recovery Recommendations

WSO2 Identity Server does not persist data in the file systems or retain or
generate artifacts. By default, it only stores log files in the file
system and data and artifacts in the databases and the repository.

## What you should back up

1.  **Database backups** :
    -   Back up of all the databases defined in
        `            <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml           `
        .

2.  **Artifact backups** :

    - This includes hot-deployment artifacts, web applications, synapse
    files, tenant directories, etc. Back up of the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository         ` directory
    periodically. The frequency of the backups depends on your usage.
    For example, if you are creating or updating APIs daily, consider creating
    daily backup.

3.  **WSO2 product instance backups** :

    -  One-time-only backup that you take of the entire server directory.
    This includes all the configuration files, logs, server extensions,
    and deployment artifacts for both tenants and super tenants. This
    back up is ideally done when the server is ready to be deployed in a
    production environment.

## Backup recommendations

We recommend that you use a proper artifact management system such as [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) to back up and manage your artifacts
before deploying them in the WSO2 Carbon runtime. Also, use the [WSO2 Update Manager(WUM)](../../../deploy/get-started/get-wso2-updates)
tool, which is a command-line utility that allows you to get the latest
updates (bug fixes and security fixes) of a particular product
release.

## Recovery recommendations

Be sure to determine the following depending on your business-continuity
requirements:

-   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** : Up to what points are you to
    recover. This is determined by the latest, known, good point.
-   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** : How long does it take to recover
    to the RPO.
-   **Backup Frequency** : How frequently you should take backups. If
    your RPO is one day, your backup frequency should be daily.
-   **Disaster Recovery Site** : The place where the latest copy of your
    backup is. This can be from a different shelf in your data center to
    a completely different geographical location.

We also recommend the following:

1.  Align your artifact deployment and recovery processes.
2.  Schedule disaster recovery drills to test the recoverability of the
    system.
3.  Test your artifacts in an environment that is identical to the
    production environment before deploying them into production.

## Recovery strategy

The following steps include how to recover your setup using the backups:

1.  Recover the hot-deployment artifacts by replacing the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository         ` directory with the
    backed up copy.
2.  Recover the entire WSO2 product by directly replacing the existing
    WSO2 server directory in the production setup with the backup server
    directory. This will ensure that all the files, logs, and
    configurations made to the product do not need to be redone.
3.  To recover the databases, follow the recovery strategy recommended
    by the databases you are using. For information on supported and
    tested databases, see [Tested Database Management
    Systems](../../../deploy/environment-compatibility/#tested-dbmss).
