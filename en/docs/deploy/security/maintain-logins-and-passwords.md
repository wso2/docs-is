# Maintain Logins and Passwords

## Change the super admin password

To change the default admin password, log in to the WSO2 management console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`)
with admin/admin credentials and use the **Change my password** option.

---

## Recover a password

Use the  `         <IS_HOME>/bin/chpasswd.sh        ` script.

## Log in with an email address

You can configure WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate users using an email address instead of a username. Refer [Enable Using Email Address as the Username](../../../guides/identity-lifecycles/enable-email-as-username) for further information.
