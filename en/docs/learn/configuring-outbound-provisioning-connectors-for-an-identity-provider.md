# Configuring Outbound Provisioning Connectors for an Identity Provider

You can configure the WSO2 Identity Server to provision users to
external applications. See the [Identity Server
Architecture](../../getting-started/architecture) for more information on how this process
fits into the overall picture.

To navigate to the outbound provisioning section, do the following.

1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the Management Console. 
2.  Navigate to the Main menu to access the Identity menu. Click Add under Identity Providers.
3.  Fill in the details in the Basic Information section.

                <p>The <strong>Home Realm Identifier</strong> value can be specified in each federated IDP and can send the Home Realm Identifier value as the “fidp” query parameter (e.g., fidp=googleIdp) in the authentication request by the service provider. Then WSO2 Identity Server finds the IDP related to the “fidp” value and redirects the end user to the IDP directly rather than showing the SSO login page. By using this, you can avoid multi-option, in a multi-option scenario without redirecting to the multi-option page.</p>

You can configure outbound provisioning connectors by expanding the
relevant section.

![outbound-provisioning-connectors](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/outbound-provisioning-connectors.png)

In addition to this, you can also create [custom
connectors](../../develop/writing-an-outbound-provisioning-connector) that are added
to the list of outbound provisioning connectors once created.

#### Configuring SCIM provisioning

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is
designed to make managing user identities in the WSO2 Identity Server
easier. Identity provisioning is a key aspect of any identity management
solution and, as such, is very relevant to SCIM. In simple terms, it is
to create, maintain and delete user accounts and related identities in
one or more systems or applications in response to business processes
that are initiated either by humans directly or by automated tasks.

This configuration involves setting up the Identity Server to send
provisioning requests to an external application that supports SCIM. See
[Outbound Provisioning with SCIM](../../using-wso2-identity-server/outbound-provisioning-with-scim) for
more information on how this works in a typical scenario.

1.  Expand the **SCIM Provisioning Configuration** form.  
    ![scim-provisioning](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/scim-provisioning.png)   
    Fill in the following fields where relevant.

#### Configuring SPML provisioning

The Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is the open standard for
the integration and interoperation of service provisioning requests. The
goal of SPML is to allow organizations to securely and quickly set up
user interfaces for Web services and applications, by letting enterprise
platforms such as Web portals, application servers, and service centers
generate provisioning requests within and across organizations

This configuration involves setting up the Identity Server to send
provisioning requests to an external application that supports SPML. See
[Outbound Provisioning with SPML](../../using-wso2-identity-server/outbound-provisioning-with-spml) for
more information on how this works in a typical scenario.

1.  Expand the **SPML Provisioning Configuration** form.

2.  Fill in the following fields where relevant.
