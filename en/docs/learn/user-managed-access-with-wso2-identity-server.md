# User Managed Access with WSO2 Identity Server
WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) supports the UMA 2.0 protocol, which
allows a resource owner to easily share resources with other requesting
parties. This tutorial demonstrates how you can use WSO2 IS as the
authorization server to try out UMA for a sample scenario.

### Introduction

To demonstrate the UMA flow using WSO2 IS as the authorization server,
let’s consider a sample scenario where Kate (resource owner) wants to
share her photo album (resource) on her cloud drive (resource server)
with her friend Sam (requesting party).  Let's assume that Sam uses a
mobile app (client) to view Kate’s photo album. Note that Kate wants to
allow Sam to only have view permission to her photo album.

Once you try out the tutorial you will understand how to use UMA 2.0 to
do the following:

-   Outsource authorization.
-   Control resources and share resources in a selective manner via a
    single console (authorization server).

### Try out the UMA flow

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    [Download](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management) and install
    WSO2 Identity Server, which will act as the authorization server. Let’s
    refer to the WSO2 Identity Server installation location as
    `         <IS_HOME>        ` throughout the tutorial.
    

Now you can follow the instructions in the sections below to try out the
UMA flow.
<a name="resourceowner"></a>
#### Create the resource owner

Follow the steps below to create a user named Kate who will act as the
resource owner:

1.  Start WSO2 Identity Server and access the management console. You
    can sign in using `          admin         ` as the username and
    password. For detailed instructions on starting WSO2 Identity Server
    and accessing the management console, see [Running the
    Product](../../setup/running-the-product).
2.  On the **Main** tab, click **Add** under **Users and Roles**.
3.  Click **Add New User**.
4.  Specify the following values to create a new user.


    | Domain           | `               PRIMARY              ` |
    | Username         | `               kate              `    |
    | Password         | `               kate123              ` |
    | Confirm password | `               kate123              ` |

5.  Click **Next**.

6.  Select **admin**.
7.  Click **Finish**.

#### Create the requesting party

Follow the steps below to create a user named Sam who will act as the
requesting party:

1.  On the **Main** tab, click **Add** under **Users and Roles**.
2.  Click **Add New User**.
3.  Specify the following values to create a new user:


    | Domain           | `               PRIMARY              ` |
    | Username         | `               sam              `     |
    | Password         | `               sam123              `  |
    | Confirm password | `               sam123              `  |

4.  Click **Finish**.

Now that you have the resource owner and requesting party to try out the
scenario, next step is to configure one service provider for the
resource server and another service provider for the client acting on
behalf of the requesting party.

#### Configure service providers to act as the resource server and client

1.  Follow the steps below to configure a service provider for the
    resource server:
    1.  On the **Main** tab, click **Add** under **Service Providers**.
    2.  Enter `            kateSP           ` as the **Service Provider
        Name** and click **Register**.
    3.  Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration**, then expand
        **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration**, and then click
        **Configure**.
    4.  Enter `            https://localhost/callback           ` as the
        value for the **Callback Url**.  
        ![register-uma-app]( ../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/register-uma-app.png) 
    5.  Click **Add**.
    <a name="clientsp"></a>
2.  Follow the steps below to configuring a service provider for the
    client acting on behalf of the requesting party:  
    1.  On the **Main** tab, click **Add** under **Service Providers**.
    2.  Enter `            samSP           ` as the **Service Provider
        Name** and click **Register**.
    3.  Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration**, then expand
        **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration**, and then click
        **Configure**.
    4.  Enter
        `                         https://localhost/callback                       `
        as the value for the **Callback Url**.  
        ![register-uma-app]( ../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/register-uma-app.png) 
    5.  Click **Add**.

Note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values. You need those
values to obtain the Protection API Access Token (PAT).

#### Obtain the Protection API Access token (PAT)

-   Execute the following curl command to obtain the PAT:

    !!! tip
        -   Be sure to replace the `            <CLIENT_ID>           ` and
            `            <CLIENT_SECRET>           ` tags with the values
            you obtained when you [configured the service provider for the
            client](#clientsp).
        -   In this tutorial, the grant type that is used to obtain the PAT
            is the password grant type. Therefore, you need to pass the
            resource owners credentials in the curl command. Since [you have
            configured Kate as the resource
            owner](#resourceowner)
           , you need to pass Kate's user name and password in the curl
            command.

    ``` java
    curl -u <CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET> -k -d "grant_type=password&username=kate&password=kate123&scope=uma_protection" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
    ```

    You will get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
    {
        "access_token":"b8df48ff-feab-3632-b3dc-68ae6b4c62e2",
        "refresh_token":"1037ccad-f45a-38e7-96ad-40c00fbc7ca4",
        "scope":"uma_protection",
        "token_type":"Bearer",
        "expires_in":3600
    }
    ```

#### Register the resource

Now, you need to register the resource.

-   Execute the following curl command to register a resource named
    `           Photo Album          ` :

    !!! tip
        -   Make sure to replace the `            <PAT>           ` tag with
            the [access token you got in the previous
            section](#obtain-the-protection-api-access-token-pat).
    

    ``` java
    curl -X POST \
      https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/resourceregistration/v1.0/resource \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer 64658549-47c1-3b5a-8637-c629f16c4118' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
      "resource_scopes": [
        "view",
        "download"
      ],
      "description": "Collection of digital photographs",
      "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/flower.png",
      "name": "Photo Album 2",
      "type": "http://www.example.com/rsrcs/photoalbum"
    }'
    ```

    You will get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
    {
        "_id": "ceaa6506-1da9-456b-88d8-027797d2e081"
    }
    ```

Now you have completed registering the resource.

Next, you need to create and publish an access policy to provide
specific users appropriate permission to access the resource. In our
sample scenario, the requesting party (i.e., Sam) is only provided view
permission to the photo album. Therefore, let's create and publish a
policy so that u sers who have view permission to the album can view the
images, whereas those who have download permission can download the
images.

#### Publish a policy

Follow the steps given below to create, register and publish a policy:

1.  Sign in to the management console using Kate's credentials., which
    has `          kate         ` as the username and
    `          kate123         ` as the password:
    `          https://localhost:9443/carbon         `
2.  On the **Main** tab, go to the **Entitlement** section and click
    **Policy Administration** under **PAP**.
3.  Click **Add New Entitlement Policy** and then click **Write Policy
    in XML**.
4.  Copy the following sample policy and paste it on the **Source View**
    pane:

    Be sure to replace the
    `            {ENTER_YOUR_RESOURCE_ID}           ` tag with the
    resource ID that you obtained when you [registered the
    resource](#register-the-resource)
    .

    ``` java
        <Policy xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17"  PolicyId="UMApolicy" RuleCombiningAlgId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:rule-combining-algorithm:first-applicable" Version="1.0">

           </Rule>
           <Rule Effect="Deny" RuleId="Deny_all"></Rule>
        </Policy>
    ```

5.  **Save** the policy. You will see the new policy that you created
    listed in the **Policy Administration** page.  
    ![add-uma-policy]( ../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/add-uma-policy.png) 

6.  Select the policy and click **Publish To My PDP**. This displays
    the **Publish Policy** page.

7.  Click **Publish**. This displays a message for confirmation to
    publish the policy.
8.  Click **Yes**. This publishes the policy. If you want to view the
    published policy, click **Policy View** under **PDP**.  
    ![view-uma-policy]( ../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/view-uma-policy.png) 

#### Obtain a permission ticket

The permission endpoint allows the resource server to request permission
when a client makes a resource request without a token or if the request
contains an invalid token.

!!! tip
    
    By default, the permission ticket is valid for 300 seconds. This time
    period might not be sufficient for you to try out this tutorial and if
    the permission ticket expires you need to obtain a new permission ticket
    in order to proceed
    
    Therefore, to try out the tutorial without having to obtain a new
    permission ticket, you need to follow the step below to change the
    permission ticket expiration validity period:
    
    -   Add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` folder and set the value to 36000. 
    ```toml
    [oauth.token_validation]
    authorization_code_validity= "36000"
    ```
    

The request can contain one or more permission values by having multiple
resources and the relevant scopes of a resource owner. The request used
in this tutorial contains a single permission.

-   Execute the following curl command to obtain the permission ticket.

    -   Make sure to replace the `             <PAT>            `
        tag with the [access token you got in the previous
        section](#obtain-the-protection-api-access-token-pat)
        .
    -   Replace the `             <RESOURCE_ID>            ` tag with
        the ID you got when [registering the
        resource](#register-the-resource)
        .

    ``` java
    curl -X POST https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/permission/v1.0/permission -H 'authorization: Bearer <PAT>' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"resource_id":"<RESOURCE_ID>","resource_scopes":["view"]}]' -k
    ```

      
    You will get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
        {"ticket":"97f476f2-72d0-4540-aa08-a4784bd2053e"}
    ```

#### Obtain the OIDC id\_token

The client should pass client ID to prove its identity to the
authorization server (The user name of the requesting party is required
to evaluate the policy defined in this tutorial. In addition to the user
name, the resource owner can also define other claims to evaluate the
policy. For the sample scenario in this tutorial only the requesting
party user name is required).

-   Execute the following curl command to obtain the OIDC id\_token:

    Be sure to replace the `             <CLIENT_ID>            ` and
    `             <CLIENT_SECRET>            ` tags with the values you
    got when you [Configured the service provider for the
    client](#clientsp).

    ``` java
        curl -u <CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET> -k -d "grant_type=password&username=sam&password=sam123&scope=openid" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
    ```

    Since the grant type used here is the password grant type, you need
    to specify the requesting party credentials in the curl command.
    Because you have [configured Sam as the requesting
    party](#create-the-requesting-party)
    in this tutorial, you need to specify Sam's user name and password
    in the curl command.  
      
    You will get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
        {
           "access_token":"f2999d40-af06-3779-b157-731d6540c5de",
           "refresh_token":"f95adb62-34ae-311e-83c1-6b136eb49017",
           "scope":"openid",
           "id_token":"eyJ4NXQiOiJOVEF4Wm1NeE5ETXlaRGczTVRVMVpHTTBNekV6T0RKaFpXSTRORE5sWkRVMU9HRmtOakZpTVEiLCJraWQiOiJOVEF4Wm1NeE5ETXlaRGczTVRVMVpHTTBNekV6T0RKaFpXSTRORE5sWkRVMU9HRmtOakZpTVEiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdF9oYXNoIjoiMVhhWm43TE1LeU5sdFhFbnBOZ09fQSIsImF1ZCI6IkN6Ym42MVVmS09ZckF3azlBZjZidXIzbkthOGEiLCJzdWIiOiJzYW0iLCJhenAiOiJDemJuNjFVZktPWXJBd2s5QWY2YnVyM25LYThhIiwiYW1yIjpbInBhc3N3b3JkIl0sImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOlwvXC9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6OTQ0M1wvb2F1dGgyXC90b2tlbiIsImV4cCI6MTUzNTE4MjM5OCwiaWF0IjoxNTM1MTc4Nzk4fQ.Rs3nPOMA_Fn8iWfDpVvmgWayhKU3_hhMQg_WHPxE0P_Dg2S8qxtSHBLMj6Z_b5iXNIAKFYFA_VF9fxZnSKgmVxZiYyrD0YADbZ5Hu6PW5uQPI59c0hdXT4rCH2WG2hP4slKRqsNZ1DCleWr0aiCPLwWixyUdnPub2c98IOcheOhkOOVV6WvAtI56f2gRDzUf66-t-3ZgKgfxkT0X6uNkvkRsk3oG7nK6_2wCuyoGYIS1h0yzryZYPmRLs7Db7QShshkB9yhAHrqo8b9b7Lf8S5NAXH2fcayEBq1MaqioBN9b_11swQ6R_2IA1EgoDfZ-eKGWCjOEsKusPmuDAI4xvQ",
           "token_type":"Bearer",
           "expires_in":3600
        }
    ```

#### Obtain the requesting party token

The client acting on behalf of the requesting party has to obtain the
requesting party token (RPT) with the obtained permission ticket and the
claim token.

-   Execute the following curl command to obtain the RPT.  

    -   Make sure to replace the
        `              <CLIENT_ID>             ` and
        `              <CLIENT_SECRET>             ` tags with the
        values you got after [Configuring service provider for the
        client](#clientsp).
    -   Replace `              <PERMISSION_TICKET>             ` with
        the value you generated under the [Obtaining a permission
        ticket](#obtain-a-permission-ticket)
        section.
    -   Make sure to replace the `              <ID_TOKEN>             `
        tag with the [OIDC id\_token you
        obtained](#obtain-the-oidc-id95token)
        .

    ``` java
        curl --user <CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET> -k -d "grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Auma-ticket&ticket=<PERMISSION_TICKET>&claim_token=<ID_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
    ```

      
    You will get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
        {
           "access_token":"p8dj48ff-heah-3632-b3dc-68aenm4c62e9",
           "token_type":"Bearer",
           "expires_in":3600
        }
    ```

#### Get the token introspection

WSO2 Identity Server provides a SOAP service to validate the OAuth2
token that it has issued, which the resource server can use.

-   Execute the following curl command to get the token introspection:  

    -   Make sure to replace the `               <PAT>              `
        tag with the [access token you got in the previous
        section](#obtain-the-protection-api-access-token-pat)
        .

    -   Replace the `               <RPT>              ` tag with the [request party token you
        obtained](#obtain-the-requesting-party-token)
        .

    ``` java
        curl -v -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <PAT>" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST --data "token=<RPT>" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/introspect
    ```

    You get a response similar to the following:

    ``` java
        {  "nbf": 1553414959,
          "permissions": [
            {
              "resource_scopes": [
                "view"
              ],
              "resource_id": "08e69621-e418-4914-b85f-164e127c20de"
            }
          ],
          "active": true,
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "exp": 1553418559,
          "iat": 1553414959,
          "client_id": "JfTSiJ24gh8sYHTQVuOl5RoftkAa",
          "username": "oliver.uma.demo"
        }
    ```

If the token introspection for the RPT is successful, the resource
server can share the resource with the client.

This is how UMA works.

!!! note
    
    In order to obtain UMA related information in the introspection end
    point, add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file in the `<ISHOME>/repository/conf/` folder .  
    This is disabled by default. The response shown above with additional UMA
    related details is what we get when the following configuration is
    enabled.
    
    ``` java
    [oauth.grant_type.uma_ticket]
