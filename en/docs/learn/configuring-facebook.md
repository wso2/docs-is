# Configuring Facebook

Facebook can be used as a federated authenticator in the Identity
Server. Do the following to configure the Identity Server to
authenticate users using their Facebook credentials.

!!! note
    
    This section gives you a quick understanding of configuring Facebook as
    Identity provider so that it acts as a federated authenticator. **Check
    out the [Logging in to your application via Identity Server using
    Facebook
    Credentials](../../learn/logging-in-to-your-application-via-identity-server-using-facebook-credentials)
    tutorial** to try out an end to end scenario of using Facebook as a
    federated authenticator.
    
!!! tip "Before you begin"
    
    1.  Create a Facebook account and [register an application on
        Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/444614902378217).

    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Callback Url</td>
    <td>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected after the authentication is successful. This should be the commonauth endpoint of Identity server.</td>
