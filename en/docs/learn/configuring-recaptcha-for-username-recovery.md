# Configuring reCaptcha for Username Recovery

The user account recovery feature implemented in the WSO2 Identity
Server helps to recover the username of the account in case the user
forgets it. This recovery process can also be secured with captcha
verification.

By configuring reCaptcha, you can mitigate or block brute force attacks.
