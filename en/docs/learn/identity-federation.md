# Identity Federation

Identity and access management requirements are rapidly evolving over
the years. Organizations cannot survive with authentication and
authorization mechanisms that only span a single boundary of trust.
Hence, these organizations often provide and consume services across
trust boundaries, which may include partners, subsidiaries, customers or
suppliers and may span across multiple buildings, cities, states,
countries and even continents. Identity federation and Single Sign On
(SSO) come into the picture to provide and consume these services across
trust boundaries.

Identity federation and SSO have similarities as well as key
differences. Identity federation is a mechanism that allows
authentication across different enterprises in different trust domains
based on a trust factor. This makes access easy, as users do not have to
remember a different set of credentials for every application they use.
However, the users have to provide their credentials to each one of the
applications separately although the credentials used are the same. On
the other hand, SSO enables users to provide their credentials once and
obtain access to multiple applications. In SSO, the users are not
prompted for their credentials when accessing each application until
their session is terminated.

The following topics discuss the various features that are key to using
Identity Federation and Single-Sign-On (SSO).
