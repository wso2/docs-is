# OAuth2 Token Revocation

The OAuth Token Revocation functionality is available with WSO2 Identity
Server and follows [this
specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009). There are two
endpoints exposed as a result of the token revocation feature.

1.  **REST** endpoint at `          /oauth2/revoke         `
2.  **SOAP** endpoint at
    `          /services/OAuthAdminService         ` with operation
    `          revokeAuthzForAppsByResourceOwner         `

The REST endpoint is for OAuth 2.0 clients who want to revoke any access
granted to them by a resource owner. This could be at the discretion of
the resource owner or otherwise. In other words, this endpoint is meant
for OAuth 2.0 clients only in order to authenticate themselves using
`         client_id        ` and `         client_secret        ` and
revoke the authorization granted to them. They may use the access token
or refresh token for this purpose. Regardless of which token the client
uses, the result is the same; the client cannot access the user’s
resource again until such time the user explicitly provides a grant by
authorizing the client at the OAuth 2.0 authorization server.

The following is an example of the request that needs to be sent to the
revocation REST endpoint by OAuth 2.0 client to revoke a token:

``` java
curl -X POST --basic -u "<client id>:<client secret>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8" -k -d "token=<token to revoke>&token_type_hint=access_token" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/revoke
```

The token parameter used here can be an access token or refresh token.
The `         token_type_hint        ` parameter is optional. This
parameter can take values of either `         access_token        ` or
`         refresh_token        ` . The Identity Server uses this
parameter to speed up the process of looking up the token by searching
first in the set of tokens the client specifies (
`         access_token        ` or `         refresh_token        ` ).
If the token is not to be found in the set the client claims it to be
in, then the server looks for the token in the other set (
`         refresh_token        ` or `         access_token        ` ).

The **SOAP** endpoint, on the other hand, is for the resource owners to
directly interact with the Authorization server and revoke authorization
grants for applications they previously granted access to, without the
OAuth 2.0 application/client being an intermediary in the process. The
use of this **SOAP** endpoint is demonstrated by the WSO2 Identity
Server’s dashboard under **Authorized Apps** ‘ for resource owners to
login and revoke application authorization.

1.  Go to the dashboard URL: <https://localhost:9443/dashboard/> .
2.  Click the **Login** button.
3.  Enter your username and password and click the **Sign In**
    button. The dashboard appears.
4.  Click the **View details** button to access the components.
5.  Once you have logged in, click **View details** under **Authorized
    Apps**. The following page appears, listing out the available
    apps.  
    ![oauth-authorized-apps]( ../../assets/using-wso2-identity-server/103329616/oauth-authorized-apps.png)

The **Authorized Apps** page indicates the user has granted
authorization to the application ‘ `         travelocity        ` ′
created by user ‘ `         admin        ` ’.

The token revocation end-point also supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing) specification and also JSONP (Remote JSON – JSONP).

CORS is supported through CORS-Filter which can be found
[here](http://software.dzhuvinov.com/cors-filter.html). The CORS Filter
is designed to be plugged to a webapp using its deployment descriptor (
`         web.xml        ` ). Since the OAuth 2.0 endpoints in WSO2
Identity Server have been written as JAX-RS endpoints, you can add the
required CORS configurations to its deployment descriptor.

You can find this webapp at
`         <IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps/oauth2.war        `
. Rather than editing the `         web.xml        ` directly in the
deployed directory, its easier to copy the `         oauth2.war        `
file into another location, edit the `         web.xml        ` and copy
it back into the `         webapps        ` folder and it gets hot
deployed.

Example of a JSONP revocation request:

``` java
curl -X POST --basic -u "<client id>:<client secret>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8" -k -d "token=<token to revoke>&token_type_hint=access_token&callback=package.myCallback" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/revoke
```

The `         callback        ` parameter is optional.
