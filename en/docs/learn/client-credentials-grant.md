# Client Credentials Grant

### Recommended use

This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication or for a
client making requests to an API that does not require the user’s
permission. This grant should be allowed for use only by trusted
clients.

### The flow

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials
with this grant type. It is similar to the [resource owner password
credentials grant](../../learn/resource-owner-password-credentials-grant) type
except in this case, only the client’s credentials are used to
authenticate a request for an access token.

  

The diagram below illustrates the client credentials grant flow.
