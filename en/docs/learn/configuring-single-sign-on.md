# Configuring Single Sign-On

Single sign-on is a key feature of the WSO2 Identity Server that enables
users to access multiple applications using the same set of credentials.
Additionally, the user can access all these applications without having
to log into each applicationÂ individually. For instance, if users log
into application A, they would automatically have access to application
B as well for the duration of that session without having to re-enter
their credentials.

WSO2 Identity Server supports single sign-on using different protocols. For hands-on tutorials that demonstrate SSO using two sample applications, see the following topics: 

- [Configuring Single Sign-On Using SAML2](../../learn/configuring-single-sign-on-saml)
- [Configuring Single Sign-On Using OpenID Connect](../../learn/configuring-single-sign-on-oidc)
- [Configuring Single Sign-On Using Integrated Windows Authentication](../../learn/configuring-iwa-single-sign-on)
- [Configuring Single Sign-On Using WS-Federation](../../learn/configuring-single-sign-on-wsfed)
