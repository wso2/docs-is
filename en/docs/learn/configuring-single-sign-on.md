# Configuring Single Sign-On

Single sign-on is a key feature of the WSO2 Identity Server that enables
users to access multiple applications using the same set of credentials.
Additionally, the user can access all these applications without having
to log into each application individually. For instance, if users log
into application A, they would automatically have access to application
B as well for the duration of that session without having to re-enter
their credentials.

The profile specification for Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0
(SAML 2.0) defines single sign-on based on a web browser. This topic
provides instructions on how to use the sample available in the WSO2
Identity Server to configure SSO using SAML 2.0 with a sample service
provider.

!!! Info
	  You can find more information regarding the SAML2 and SAML2 Web Browser
	  SSO Profile in the
	  [saml-core](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)
	  specification and the
	  [saml-profile](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf)
	  specification.

!!! Note

    Before you begin!

    -   To ensure you get the full understanding of this tutorial, the
        sample Travelocity application is used in this use case. Therefore,
        make sure to [download the samples](../../learn/downloading-a-sample) before
        you begin.
    -   [Download Tomcat 7.x](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi).
        The  samples are written on Servlet 3.0. Therefore, they need to be
        deployed on Tomcat 7.x.
    -   Install Apache Maven. For more information, see [Installation
        Prerequisites](../../setup/installation-prerequisites).


### Configuring the SSO web application

To obtain and configure the single sign-on Travelocity sample, follow
the steps below.

1.  Add the following entry to the `            /etc/hosts           `
    file of your machine to configure the hostname.
    ``` bash
      127.0.0.1  wso2is.local
    ```

    ??? Info "For more information, click to expand"

    	  Some browsers do not allow creating cookies for a naked hostname,
    	  such as `             localhost            ` . Cookies are required
    	  when working with SSO. Therefore, to ensure that the SSO
    	  capabilities work as expected in this tutorial, you need to
    	  configure the `             etc/host            ` file as explained
    	  in this step.

    	  The `             etc/host            ` file is a read-only file.
    	  Therefore, you won't be able to edit it by opening the file via a
    	  text editor. To avoid this, edit the file using the terminal
    	  commands.  
    	  For example, use the following command if you are working on a
    	  Mac/Linux environment.

   	     ``` java
    	    sudo nano /etc/hosts
   	     ```


2.  Open the `            travelocity.properties           ` file found
    in the
    `            is-samples/modules/samples/sso/sso-agent-sample/src/main/resources           `
    directory of the samples folder you just checked out. Configure the
    following property with the hostname (
    `            wso2is.local           ` ) that you configured above.

    ``` text
     #The URL of the SAML 2.0 Assertion Consumer
     SAML2.AssertionConsumerURL=http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp
    ```

3.  In your terminal, navigate to
    `            is-samples/modules/samples/sso/sso-agent-sample           `
    folder and build the sample using the following command. You must
    have Apache Maven installed to do this

    ``` java
      mvn clean install
    ```

4.  After successfully building the sample, a
    `            .war           ` file named **travelocity.com** can be
    found inside the
    `            is-samples/sso/sso-agent-sample/           `
    `            target           ` directory. Deploy this sample web
    app on a web container. To do this, use the Apache Tomcat server.

    !!! info

        Since this sample is written based on Servlet 3.0 it needs to be
        deployed on [Tomcat 7.x](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)
        .


    Use the following steps to deploy the web app in the web container:

    1.  Stop the Apache Tomcat server if it is already running.
    2.  Copy the
        `                           travelocity.com.war                         `
        file to the `             <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps            `
        directory.
    3.  Start the Apache Tomcat server.

!!! Note

    If you wish to change properties like the issuer ID, consumer URL, and
    IdP URL, you can edit the **travelocity.properties** file found in the
    `          travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes         ` directory. If the
    service provider is configured in a tenant you can use the
    `          QueryParams         ` property to send the tenant domain.
    For  example, `          QueryParams=tenantDomain=wso2.com         ` .

    This sample uses the following default values.

    | Properties                                                                                                  | Description                                                         |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `              SAML2.SPEntityId=travelocity.com             `                                               | A unique identifier for this SAML 2.0 Service Provider application. |
    | `               SAML2.AssertionConsumerURL=http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp              ` | The URL of the SAML 2.0 Assertion Consumer.                         |
    | `               SAML2.IdPURL=https://localhost:9443/samlsso              `                                  | The URL of the SAML 2.0 Identity Provider.                          |

    If you edit the
    `                     travelocity.properties                   ` file,
    you must restart the Apache Tomcat server for the changes to take
    effect.


Now the web application is successfully deployed on a web container.

### Configuring the service provider

The next step is to configure **travelocity.com** as the service
provider. The following steps instruct you on how to do this.

1.  Sign in to the WSO2 Identity Server [Management
    Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console) using
    default administrator credentials (the username and password are
    both `          admin         ` ). If you need to create the service
    provider in a tenant space, you need to login with tenants user.
2.  On the **Main** menu, click **Identity \> Service Providers \> Add**
    .
3.  Enter `          travelocity.com         ` as the value for the
    **Service Provider Name** field and click **Register**.
4.  The **Service Providers** screen appears. Copy the content in the
    .pem file of your service provider application certificate and paste
    it as the value for **Application Certificate**. In WSO2 IS
    versions prior to WSO2 IS 5.5.0, the certificates were stored in the
    keystore file. From 5.5.0 onwards, the certificate is stored in the
    database and can be directly added via the management console using
    the **Application Certificate** field.

    !!! info

        If the **Application Certificate** field is left blank, WSO2 
        Identity server is backward compatible and follows
        the previous implementation to locate the certificates in the
        keystore.  
        This means that in the SAML SSO flow, the certificate alias
        mentioned in SAML inbound authentication configuration is used if
        the Application Certificate field is left blank.

        For more information on Application Certificate and its usage, click
    	[here](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-a-service-provider/#app-cert).

5.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and then
    expand **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration**.

6.  Click **Configure**.

7.  Select **Manual Configuration** and register the new service
    provider by providing the following values.  
    ![register-new-service-provider-manual-config](../../assets/img/tutorials/register-new-service-provider-manual-config.png)

!!! Note
		To add the correct tenant domain with the username as the
		subject identifier in tenant mode,

		Expand the **Local & Outbound Authentication Configuration** section
		and do the following.

		-   Select **Use tenant domain in local subject identifier**
		    to append the tenant domain to the local subject identifier.
		-   Select **Use user store domain in local subject identifier**
		    to append the user store domain that the user resides in the
		    local subject identifier.  
		    ![local-and-outbound-config](../../assets/img/tutorials/local-and-outbound-config.png)

		    For **super tenant mode**, this step is not required and the two
		    options mentioned above should remain disabled by default.

### Configuring claims

1. Configure claims for the service provider. To do this, do the
   following.

    !!! Info
        For more information on configuring this, see
        [Configuring Claims for a Service
        Provider](../../learn/configuring-claims-for-a-service-provider).
1. Expand the **Claim Configuration** section in the service provider form.
2. You can select the claims that must be sent to the service provider. If you just want to send them as claim URIs, select **Use Local Claim Dialect**.
3. Alternatively, if you want to define new claim URIs for the
        attributes that are sent, you can define any values for them and
        map these values with the claim URIs local to WSO2.  

        For example, if you want to set the email address of the user as
        `            http://serviceprovider.org/claims/emailaddress           `
        claim URI, you can define it here and map it in to
        `            http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress           ` .
        To specify this, select the **Define Custom Claim Dialect**
        option and click **Add Claim URI**. Enter the **Service
        Provider Claim** URIs and select the matching local claim from
        the drop down. You can also mark them as a **Requested Claim**
        or a **Mandatory Claim**.

        For more information, see
        [Configuring Claims for a Service
        Provider](../../learn/configuring-claims-for-a-service-provider).  
        ![configure-sso-claims](../../assets/img/tutorials/configure-sso-claims.png)

2.  Configure outbound authentication as **Default** authentication
    type. This specifies that the identity provider authenticates the
    users with the username/password by validating with the identity
    provider's user store.

3.  After providing the above information, click **Register**.

After successfully registering the service provider, log out from
management console. The next step is to run the sample.

### Running the sample

1.  Visit `          http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com         `
    . You are directed to the following page:  
    ![travelocity-login](../../assets/img/tutorials/travelocity-login.png)
2.  Since you need to use SAML2 for this sample, click the first link,
    i.e., **Click here to login with SAML from Identity Server**. You
    are redirected to the Identity Server for authentication.
3.  Enter the default admin credentials (admin/admin).
4.  Once you have provided the correct credentials, you are redirected
    to the consent request screen for approval.

    !!! Note

        This screen will appear at this point if WSO2 Identity
        Server has all the mandatory claim values of the user in the system.
        If not, the user will be redirected to the relevant screen and
        prompted to provide the missing mandatory claim values before
        providing consent.

        For more information about user consent in the SSO authentication
        flow, see [Consent Management with
        Single-Sign-On](../../learn/consent-management-with-single-sign-on).


    ![travelocity-user-consent](../../assets/img/tutorials/travelocity-user-consent.png)

5.  Select the claims that you consent to share with the Travelocity
    application and click **Approve**. You have to provide consent for
    all the mandatory claims at a minimum to complete authentication.

6.  After providing consent, you are redirected to the Travelocity
    application home page.

!!! note

    1.  To view the SAML request and response, add the following
        debug log to the `           log4j.properties          ` file found
        inside `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf          ` .

        ``` java
        log4j.logger.org.wso2.carbon.identity=DEBUG
        ```

    2.  Since single log out is enabled, if you click the logout button in
        the travelocity.com home page, you will successfully log out.
