# Configuring reCaptcha for Password Recovery

The password account recovery feature implemented in the WSO2 Identity
Server helps to recover the password of the account in case the user
forgets it. This recovery process can also be secured with captcha
verification.

By configuring reCaptcha, you can mitigate or block brute force attacks.
