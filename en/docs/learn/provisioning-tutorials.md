# Provisioning 

## Introduction

Provisioning is the process of creating, maintaining, and deleting digital identities (accounts) for users of a system(s) and linking appropriate rights to identities in the form of rules and roles. Identity provisioning is key for Identity Federation. Identity federation is a mechanism that allows authentication across different enterprises in different trust domains based on a trust factor. This makes access easy, as users do not have to remember a different set of credentials for every application they use. The following identity provisioning concepts are used in WSO2 Identity Server.
