# Adding and Configuring an Identity Provider

### Introduction

An Identity Provider (IdP) is responsible for authenticating users and
issuing identification information by using security tokens like [SAML
2.0](../../tutorials/saml-2.0-web-sso), [OpenID
Connect](../../tutorials/oauth2-openid-connect),
[OAuth 2.0](../../tutorials/oauth2-openid-connect)
and [WS-Trust](../../tutorials/ws-trust). This is a
favourable alternative to explicitly authenticating a user within a
security realm.

The responsibility of the identity provider configuration is to
represent external identity providers. These external identity providers
can be Facebook, Yahoo, Google, Salesforce, Microsoft Windows Live, etc.
If you want to authenticate users against these identity providers, then
you must associate one or more federated authenticators with the WSO2
Identity Server. These identity providers support for different
authentication protocols. For example, if you want to authenticate users
against Salesforce, then you must associate the SAML 2.0 authenticator
with the Salesforce identity provider, if you want to authenticate users
against Yahoo, then you must associate the OpenID Connect authenticator
with it. To make this process much easier, the WSO2 Identity Server also
comes with a set of more specific federated authenticators. For example,
if you want to authenticate against Facebook, you do not need to
configure OAuth 2.0 authenticator. Instead, you can directly use the
Facebook federated authenticator.

Each identity provider configuration can also maintain a claim mapping.
This is to map the identity provider's own set of claims to WSO2
Identity Server's claims. When the response from an external identity
provider is received by the response processor component of the
federated authenticator, before it hands over the control to the
authentication framework, the response processor will create a
name/value pair of user claims received in the response from the
identity provider. These claims are specific to the external identity
provider. Then it is the responsibility of the authentication framework
to read the claim mapping configuration from the identity provider
component and do the conversion. So, while inside the framework, all the
user claim values will be in a common format.

So, in short, WSO2 Identity Server allows you to add identity providers
and specify various details that help you to link the identity provider
to WSO2 Identity Server.  Therefore, you must specify all information
required to send the authentication requests and get a response back
from the identity provider. This topic contains the following sections.

### Adding an identity provider

Follow the instructions below to add a new identity provider.

1.  Access the WSO2 Identity Server [Management
    Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console) and sign in
    as an admin user.
2.  On the **Main** tab, click **Identity \> Identity Providers \> Add**
    .  
    ![add-idp]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/add-idp.png) 

3.  Fill in the details in the **Basic Information** section.  
    ![basic-info]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/basic-info.png)   
    Note the following when filling the above form.

    <td><p>The <strong>Home Realm Identifier</strong> value can be specified in each federated IDP and can send the Home Realm Identifier value as the “fidp” query parameter (e.g., fidp=googleIdp) in the authentication request by the service provider. Then WSO2 Identity Server finds the IDP related to the “fidp” value and redirects the end user to the IDP directly rather than showing the SSO login page. By using this, you can avoid multi-option, in a multi-option scenario without redirecting to the multi-option page.</p></td>

    <p>The <strong>Identity Provider Public Certificate</strong> is the public certificate of the identity provider. Uploading this is necessary to authenticate responses from the identity provider.<br />
    If necessary, you can upload multiple certificates for an identity provider. This is useful in scenarios where one certificate is expired, but the second can be used for certificate validation.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a scenario where a third party IDP needs to change its certificate in one week, but cannot specify the exact time that the certificate would change. In such a scenario, it is useful to be able to upload a secondary certificate to the IDP so that during SAML assertion validation if certificate validation fails with the first certificate, the second certificate can be used for certificate validation.</p>

    ??? note "Click here for more information on the federation hub and the home realm identifier"

        !!! info "About the federation hub and the home realm identifier"

            The federation hub has multiple identity providers configured to it.
            In a typical federation hub with multiple identity providers, each
            identity provider can have a unique home realm identifier that can
            be used to identify the identity provider you are logging into.

            So when a user tries to log in to a service provider following flow
            will happen,

            -   The Identity Server which this service provider is configured on
                will find the required federated authenticator from the service
                provider configuration
            -   If this Identity Provider configured as a federation hub, the
                user can specify the preferred identity provider in the
                federation hub using the multi-option page of the first Identity
                Server.
            -   This information will pass with the authentication request to
                the federation hub.
            -   When the request comes to the federation hub, it is sent to the
                identity provider that the user specifies from the first
                identity server. For instance, if the users prefer to use their
                Facebook credentials to log in, and Facebook is one of the
                identity providers configured in the federation hub, the user
                simply has to specify Facebook as the domain in the login screen
                of first Identity Server.

            ![fed-hub-home-realm-identifier]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/fed-hub-home-realm-identifier.png) 

            When the Home Realm Identifier is not specified, you can either
            select the domain name from a dropdown in the login page, or you
            have to enter the domain value in a separate page prior to logging
            in. This can be configured as explained below.

            Open the
            `              <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/application-authentication.xml             `
            file. The `              ProxyMode             ` configuration
            allows the framework to operate in either
            `              smart             ` mode or
            `              dumb             ` mode. In
            `              smart             ` mode, both local and federated
            authentication is supported, while in
            `              dumb             ` mode, only federated
            authentication is supported. If `              dumb             `
            mode is configured here, you must provide the Home Realm Identifier,
            or you have to display a separate screen to the user to get it.

            ![home-realm-identifier]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/home-realm-identifier.png) 

            If smart mode is configured, the default behavior applies, where you
            can enter a local username and password, or use federated
            authenticators for authentication.

            `              <ProxyMode>smart</ProxyMode>             `

    ??? note "Click here for more information on the Alias"

        !!! info "About the Alias"

            The **Alias** is used in the following authentication scenario.

            ![alias-authentication]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/alias-authentication.png)

            Here a SAML identity provider sends a SAML token to a web
            application for authentication. The SAML token has an audience
            restriction element that controls access and has a reference to the
            web application in order to access it. Using this token, the
            authentication takes place. Now, if the web application needs to
            access an API that is protected by OAuth 2.0, the same SAML token is
            sent to the token endpoint of the Identity Server. The **Alias**
            value you configure in the Identity Server is associated with this
            token endpoint. This alias value must be added to the audience
            restriction element of the SAML token. When this SAML token is sent
            to the Identity Server, you obtain an access token, which is used to
            access the API.

            So in order to configure this, you must add the SAML identity
            provider as an identity provider in the Identity Server using the
            instructions in this topic. When configuring this in the Identity
            Server, you must specify the token alias for this scenario to work.
            This indicates that any token coming from the SAML identity provider
            must have this alias value in the audience restriction element.

4.  Enter the **Identity Provider Name** and provide a brief
    **Description** of the identity provider. Only **Identity Provider
    Name** is a required field.

### Configuring a resident identity provider

Apart from mediating authentication requests between service providers
and identity providers, WSO2 Identity Server can act as a service
provider and an identity provider. When WSO2 Identity Server acts as an
identity provider, it is called the **resident identity provider**.

!!! note
    
    The resident identity provider configuration is helps service providers
    to send authentication or provisioning requests to WSO2 Identity Server
    via SAML, OpenID Connect, SCIM, or WS-Trust. For an example on how a
    resident identity provider is used to implement a security token
    service, see [Configuring WS-Trust Security Token
    Service](../../tutorials/configuring-ws-trust-security-token-service). The Resident
    identity provider configuration is a one-time configuration for a given
    tenant. It shows WSO2 Identity Server's metadata, e.g., endpoints. The
    resident identity provider configurations can be used to secure the
    WS-Trust endpoint with a security policy.
    

Follow the instructions below to configure a resident identity provider:

1.  Access the WSO2 Identity Server Management Console.
2.  Sign in as an admin user.
3.  On the **Main** tab, click **Identity \> Identity Providers \>
    Resident**.  
    ![idp-resident-main](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/idp-resident-main.png)   
    The Resident Identity Provider page appears.  
    ![resident-identity-provider](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/resident-identity-provider.png) 

4.  Enter the required values as given below.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Field</th>

    <tr class="odd">
    <td><strong>Home Realm Identifier</strong></td>
    <td>This is the domain name of the identity provider. If you do not enter a value here, when an authentication request comes to WSO2 Identity Server, a user will be prompted to specify a domain. You can enter multiple identifiers as a comma-separated list.</td>
    <td><code>                localhost               </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><strong>Idle Session Time Out</strong></td>
    <td>This is the duration in minutes for which an SSO session can be idle for. If WSO2 Identity Server does not receive any SSO authentication requests for the given duration, a session time out occurs. The default value is <code>                15               </code> .</td>
    <td><code>                15               </code></td>

        `            <IS_HOME>/repository/conf           ` directory and
        add the following configuration.
    
        ``` xml
        [server]
        hostname = "localhost"
        ```
    
    2.  Open the `            deployment.toml           ` file in the
        `            <IS_HOME>/repository/conf         `

        To ensure the client application is communicating with the right
        identity provider, WSO2 Identity Server compares the destination
        value in the SAML request with the URL in the above configuration.
    

### <a name="exporting-saml2-metadata-of-the-resident-idp"></a> Exporting SAML2 metadata of the resident IdP

To configure WSO2 Identity Server as a trusted identity provider in a
service provider application, export the SAML2 metadata of the resident
identity provider of WSO2 IS and import the metadata to the relevant
service provider.

!!! tip
    
    Use **one** of the following approaches to do this.
    
    -   Start the server and download the SAML2 metadata by accessing this
        URL: <https://localhost:9443/identity/metadata/saml2>.
    -   **Alternatively**, access the management console and follow the
        steps given below to download the metadata.
    

1.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and then
    expand **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration**.
2.  Click **Download SAML2 metadata**. A
    `           metadata.xml          ` file will be downloaded on to
    your machine.
3.  Import the `            metadata.xml           ` file to the
    relevant service provider to configure WSO2 Identity Server as a
    trusted identity provider for your application.
