# Analyzing Overall Login Attempts

The **Overall Login Attempts** statistical visualization displays
statistics relating to overall authentication activities carried out by
WSO2 Identity Server.

An overall authentication encompasses a sequence of authentication
steps. In order for an overall authentication to be considered as
successful, all its constituent steps shoudl be successful. A failure of
even a single step within the sequence causes the overall authentication
to be marked as a failure.

The statistics displayed in this page include:

-   The overall success and failure rate for login attempts over time
-   The login attempts filtered based on service providers and users

Follow the steps below to view the **Overall** statistical
visualization.
