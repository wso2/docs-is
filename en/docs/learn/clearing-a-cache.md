# Clearing a Cache

A cache is a temporary storage area which helps to store attribute
values and decision values during policy evaluation. This helps to
improve the performance of the XACML engine. Cache clearing should be
done during an "UPDATE" or "DELETE" of a policy. Once the cache is
cleared, all the temporary values will be deleted and the policy will be
re-evaluated.
