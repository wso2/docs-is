# Account Recovery

This section describes the usage of the User Information Recovery APIs
in WSO2 IdentityÂ Server. Using the API there are two ways to recover a
lost/forgotten password, i.e., by using email notifications or by using
secret questions. Additionally it is also possible to retrieve the
username if forgotten. See the following topics for more information on
how to do all this.
