# Configuring On-Demand Provisioning with Azure AD

This tutorial guides you through creating a new user and provisoning
them to the Azure Active Directory at the point of authentication.

### Prerequisites

-   [Configure SAML2 authentication for Office365 with WSO2
    IS](../../tutorials/configuring-office365-saml2-with-wso2-identity-server).

    !!! tip
    
        The tutorial linked above uses SAML2 for identity
        federation.  
        To configure Office365 with WSO2 IS using **WS-Federation** instead,
        see [Configuring Office365 WS-Federation with WSO2
        IS](../../tutorials/configuring-office365-ws-federation-with-wso2-is).
    

-   [Configure a WSO2 IS instance with the Office 365 Outbound
    provisioning
    Connector](../../develop/microsoft-azure-ad-outbound-provisioning-connector).

-   If you are using the default H2 database in WSO2 Identity Server and
    not an Active Directory user store, expand the section below and
    follow the steps.

    ??? note "Click here to expand..."

        1.  Log in to the management console using admin/admin credentials.
        2.  Click **List** under **Claims** and select the
                <http://wso2.org/claims> dialect.
        3.  Find the following claims, click **Edit,** and update mapped
                attribute in each of the claims according to the following
                table.

        | Claim             | Mapped Attribute |
        |-------------------|------------------|
        | ObjectGuid        | scimid           |
        | UserPrincipalName | mail             |
           
        d\.  Click **Update** after updating each claim.

### Configuring adaptive authentication for Office365

1.  Create a new user named "Alex". Do not assign any roles to the user.
2.  Click **List** under **Users and Roles** and click **Users**.
3.  Click **User Profile** to edit Alex's user profile. Enter values for
    the following fields.
4.  Click **List** under **Service Providers** and edit the service
    provider named "Office365" which you created previously as
    instructed in the [Configuring the service
    provider](../../tutorials/configuring-office365-saml2-with-wso2-identity-server#configuring-the-service-provider)
    section.
5.  Expand **Local and Outbound Configuration** and click **Advanced
    Configuration**.

6.  Click on **Templates** on the right side of the **Script Based
    Adaptive Authentication** field and then click **Office365-Based**.
    This adds basic authentication as the first authentication step and
    configures the Office-365-Based authentication script.

7.  Click **Ok**. The authentication script assigns the role
    “office365Role” to all successfully authenticated users who attempt
    to log in to Microsoft Online.

    !!! tip
    
        If the role you added is not named "office365Role" and you
        have used a different name for the role, edit the authentication
        script accordingly.
    

8.  Click **Update** to save the configurations.

### Trying it out

1.  Access the Microsoft login page URL:
    [https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
    .

2.  Enter `          alex@<Your_Federated_Domain>         ` and click
    **Next**. Replace the `          <Your_Federated_Domain>         `
    placeholder with the domain which is configured as federated in
    Azure AD.

3.  The browser is redirected to the WSO2 IS login page. Enter
    credentials for the user Alex and click **Sign in**.  
    ![enter-credentials-wso2is](../../assets/img/tutorials/enter-credentials-wso2is.jpg)
4.  You are prompted to provide user consent. Click **Select All** and
    then **Approve.**

    ![approve-user-consent](../../assets/img/tutorials/approve-user-consent.jpg)

5.  Click **Yes** to enable single sign-on on the next page. If this
    page does not appear, wait a few minutes until the user " Alex" is
    provisioned in Azure AD and repeat step 10 and 11.  
    ![enable-sso](../../assets/img/tutorials/enable-sso.png)
6.  You are now successfully logged in to the Office 365. The user
    "Alex" has been provisioned to the Azure AD after successful
    authentication.
