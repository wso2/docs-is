# Adding a Workflow Engine

This section demonstrates how to configure the WSO2 Identity Server (IS)
to connect to the [Business Process Management (BPM) component of WSO2
Enterprise
Integrator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Business+Process+Management)
. This can be done by creating a BPM Workflow Engine and configuring it
accordingly. You can have many engines configured in different profiles
and use one of them when creating a workflow.

!!! info 
    An embedded Business Process Management engine is included in WSO2
    Identity Server. However, if you need more flexibility and more
    extensibility with this feature than what is currently provided, it is
    advisable to [integrate the Business Process Management (BPM) component
    of WSO2 Enterprise
    Integrator](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-the-bpm-profile-of-wso2-ei-as-a-workflow-engine)
    with the Identity Server.

1.  To create a BPM profile click on **Configure \> Workflow Engine
    Profiles \> Add**. The window below will be displayed.

2.  Fill in the details using the descriptions below to guide you and
    click **Add**.

### What's next?

-   Need more flexibility and more extensibility with this feature?
    [Integrate the Business Process Management (BPM) component of WSO2
    Enterprise Integrator with the Identity
    Server](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-the-bpm-profile-of-wso2-ei-as-a-workflow-engine)
    .
-   Now you need to create a new workflow definition. For more
    information, see [Adding a New Workflow
    Definition](../../using-wso2-identity-server/adding-a-new-workflow-definition).
