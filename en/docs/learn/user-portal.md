## Export user profile

Using the export user profile feature in the user portal you can download a JSON file in including your personal information, consents, and other claims. This will allow the user to get an idea about what information about them is recorded in the WSO2 identity server.

!!! tip

        The consent receipts in the
        `           userInfo.json          ` file contain the PII controller information 
        as it is at the time that the receipt is generated. If the PII controller has 
        changed after the receipt was generated, this change will not be reflected in the 
        existing receipts. To get an updated consent receipt that reflects the change, 
        generate a new consent receipt by doing one of the following:
    
        1.  Revoke the consent via the user portal and go through the flow that prompts 
            the relevant consent again (e.g., revoke the given consent for and application 
            in WSO2 IS, log out, then log back in and approve consent again. A new consent 
            receipt will be generated for that application consent).

        2.  Use the [Consent Management REST APIs](../../develop/using-the-consent-management-rest-apis) to revoke the
            existing consent and add a new consent.

You can export your profile by following the instructions given below.

1. [Access the user portal](#accessing-the-user-portal-and-its-components).
2. Click the **Personal info** tab on the side panel.
3. Under the Export profile sub section click on the **Download as JSON** button and all your profile details will be             downloaded to your local machine as a JSON file.

## Reset password

We usually advise the users to reset their passwords regularly as a security measure. Using the user portal now you can change your password without much hassle. In order to change the password using the user portal please follow the instructions given below.

## Account recovery

The main part of account recovery is setting up security or challenge questions for user accounts. With the WSO2 Identity Server, you can set up challenge questions in different languages.

The user portal allows users to add and update their challenge questions and update the email address that they can use to recover their accounts when required. Follow the following instructions to use the account recovery options available in the user portal more effectively.

## Multi-factor authentication

MFA creates a layered defense and makes it more difficult for an unauthorized person to access a target such as a physical location, computing device, web service, network, or database. If one factor is compromised or broken, the attacker still has at least one more barrier to breach before successfully breaking into the target. WSO2 Identity Server allows configuring multi-step authentication where you can define an authentication chain containing different authenticators in different steps.

Using the latest user portal users can update their mobile numbers through which they can authenticate themselves using the one-time verification code. Also, they can add inherence factors like FIDO devices and fingerprint sensors. The following section will provide instructions on how to configure MFA options in WSO2 IS using the user portal.

### Via SMS

1. [Access the user portal](#accessing-the-user-portal-and-its-components).
2. Click the **Security tab** on the side panel.
3. Under the Multi-factor authentication section click on the **edit** button with the pencil icon aligning with via SMS          section.
4. Enter the mobile number you need to add as MFA factor and click update button.

    !!! info
        Please note that this will also update your mobile number in the user profile.

### Via security device

!!! info
        Please note that this is supported by only few browsers including chrome, mozilla firefox, Microsoft Edge.

## Monitor active user sessions

The Active user sessions section in the user portal enables users to view details relating to the sessions of the different applications that accessed via WSO2 IS. When you click on the show more button aligning with a specific session, it will display a detailed view of the session including the operating system, ip address, applications list, login time and the last accessed time.

Depending on the user’s preference the user portal allows the users either to terminate all the sessions at once or terminate sessions one by one. By clicking the terminate all button at the top right corner users can terminate all the active sessions with a single button click where as if they wish to terminate a specific session they can click on the terminate session in the detailed view section.

## Consent management

WSO2 IS provides a comprehensive consent management solution that can be used to manage consents related to Identity and Access Management (IAM) and also to manage consents that belong to third party applications.
The user portal allows users to revoke or edit their consent given to applications registered in the WSO2 Identity Server. In order to edit or revoke application consents please refer to the instructions given below.

### Revoke consent

1. [Access the user portal](#accessing-the-user-portal-and-its-components).

## Review pending approvals

The WSO2 Identity Server enables you to have more control over the tasks that are executed in it by using workflows. This is particularly useful in a scenario where you are approving user accounts in the Identity Server. Workflows provide you with the flexibility to configure this approval process in the way that suits your scenario.

The user portal allows you to review the workflow operations like adding users, updating user claims, deleting users and approve or deny them. For the convenience of the users we have categorised the pending approvals into three states which are ready, reserved and completed.

For example, suppose you need to approve all the user creation in the identity server, so whenever a user gets created in the system that task will appear under the ready section waiting for your approval. Whenever you review a task and claim it that task will be listed under reserved section of approvals. Once you approve or deny the task it will appear under the completed section.
