# Request Object Support

##### Purpose of Request Object in OpenID Connect

This enables sending authentication request parameters in a
self-contained JWT instead of plain request parameters. Request Object
can be specified to the authorization server either by *value* or by
*reference* .

**Request Object by Value** (as ***request*** parameter)

-   The request authorization request parameter enables OpenID Connect
    requests to be passed in a single, self-contained parameter and has
    to be optionally signed and/or encrypted. It represents the request
    as a JWT whose claims are the request parameters. This JWT is called
    a **Request Object.**

-   IS-5.5.0 has inbuilt support for passing Request Object by value.

**Request Object by Reference** (as ***request\_uri*** parameter )

-   The request\_uri authorization request parameter enables OpenID
    Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.
    This parameter is used identically to the request parameter, other
    than that the Request Object value is retrieved from the resource at
    the specified URL.

-   WSO2 Identity Server 5.5.0 does not support passing Request Object
    by Reference. However, an extension point is provided which can be
    extended to provide support for understanding Request Object from
    reference URI specified by request\_uri.
      

**Request Object by Value**

As mentioned above, the main purpose of this parameter is for supporting
to request some claims other than the default Userinfo and IdToken claim
set which is associated with the requested scope. Now, let us consider
the following sample request that contains a JWT as the ***request***
parameter value.

``` java
  https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize?
    response_type=code%20id_token
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid
    &state=af0ifjsldkj

The payload of the above sample Request Object is as follows:

``` java
{
  "iss": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "aud": "https://server.example.com",
  "response_type": "code id_token",
  "client_id": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "redirect_uri": "https://client.example.org/cb",
  "scope": "openid",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
  "max_age": 86400,
  "claims": {
    "userinfo": {
      "given_name": {
        "essential": true
      },
      "nickname": null,
      "email": {
        "essential": true
      },
      "email_verified": {
        "essential": true
      },
      "picture": null
    },
    "id_token": {
      "gender": null,
      "birthdate": {
        "essential": true
      },
      "acr": {
        "values": [
          "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the above request is sent, it requests some claims from both the
members **userinfo** endpoint and **id\_token**. For example, '
*given\_name'* and *'email'* are marked as essential claims from *user
info* endpoint and *'brithdate'* is requested as an essential claim from
*id token* .

Usually, in OpenID Connect, the returning claims will be filtered from
the requested scopes that are passed to the server as a query parameter
with the authorization request. When it comes to WSO2 Identity Server,
it filters the requested claims both from the requested scopes defined
with the authorization request and the requested claims that can be
configured in service provider configurations. But if the Request Object
is associated with the authorization request, the server returns the
essential request object claims in the response of **userinfo** endpoint
and **id\_token** accordingly.

  
The following validations is done on the server side.

1.  The *client\_id* and *response\_type* of the request object (if
    present) should be equal to the *client\_id* and the
    *response\_type* of the authorization request.
2.  The authorization request query parameters will be overridden from
    the *Request Object* values if they are present in the *Request
    Object.*
3.  Both the *request* and *request\_uri* parameters cannot be
    associated with the same authorization request.
4.  Even if a scope parameter is present in the Request Object value, a
    scope parameter MUST always be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request
    syntax containing the openid scope value to indicate the underlying
    OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request. (For further
    validation information, refer [OIDC
    specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests)
    )  
      

The Identity Server will respond to the above sample request as follows:

1.  Here the requested scope is considered as 'openid email' as the
    scope value of the request object is declared. So the server will
    ignore the scope value which is associated with the authorization
    request and considers the requested scope as 'openid email'
2.  It considers the claims "given\_name" and "email" which are marked
    as 'essential:true' for 'userinfo' member. Even if they are not
    mapped with the openid or address scope in the registry, if these
    claims are requested claims, then 'given\_name' and 'email' will be
    returned from the Userinfo endpoint. In a nutshell, the claims which
    are marked as 'essential: true' only get controlled by the requested
    claims and ignore the requested scopes. If the server cannot provide
    those essential claims, there will not be any failure or error
    message returning from the server.
3.  The claims like "nickname" it will act as a default claim and will
    be controlled by both requested scopes and the requested claims.
4.  If the server cannot provide the requested essential claims, the
    server will return null for the specific claim and the flow will not
    break.

!!! note
    This behavior is common to the id token as well.

Request Parameters in a Request
Object](../../tutorials/passing-oidc-authentication-request-parameters-in-a-request-object)
page to see how request objects work in IS.

##### Signature Validation

Request Object may be signed or unsigned (plaintext). When it is
plaintext, this is indicated by use of the non-algorithm \[JWA\]. If the
Request Object is signed, the server will extract the certificate by the
*client\_id* . When registering the Auth application in the Identity
Server, we need to provide the corresponding public certificate of the
Request Object signing party. As of now, the Identity Server only
supports *RSA* signature algorithms only. If the header does not contain
valid signature algorithm, the server will reject the signature
validation. Based on the certificate value, it will generate the public
key and validate the signature using the
[nimbus](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt) library.

##### Decryption

The request parameter value can be even a JWE. If it is a JWE, it will
consist of five parts which are separated by four '.'  characters which
are JOSE header, JWE encrypted key, Initialization vector, Ciphertext,
and Authentication tag. The values of these five sections can be seen by
doing a base64 encoding. JOSE header consists of 'alg' and 'enc' values.
An algorithm defined in 'enc' is used to do the content encryption while
the algorithm defined in the 'alg' is used to do the key wrapping. Here,
the nimbus library is used for the decryption by providing the Identity
Server's private key.  
  
If the Request Object is a nested JWT, which is signed and encrypted,
then the payload (Cipher Text) of the Request Object is a signed JWT. So
the server will decrypt the JWE first and then check the payload for
signature validation.


**Extension Points**  
All the validations and the request object builder are extensible so
that a third party user can build the request object and do any
validations in their own way. At the moment, Identity Server does not
have a default implementation for *request\_uri* parameter and instead,
it extracts the *request\_uri* parameter from the request object and
pass it.

So externally, a user can implement a CustomRequestObjectBuilder (by
implementing org.wso2.carbon.identity.openidconnect.RequestObjectBuilder) to
obtain the Request Object from *request\_uri* parameter and do the
necessary customizations.  
  
The following configurations should be added to the 
`          $IS_HOME/repository/conf/deployment.toml        ` file when
writing extension points for this feature.


``` toml
[oauth.oidc.request_object_builder.request_param_value_builder]  
enabled = true
class = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.openidconnect.RequestParamRequestObjectBuilder"
[oauth.oidc.extensions.request_object_validator] 
request_object_validator = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.openidconnect.RequestObjectValidatorImpl"
```

If the configuration is not present, the default classes will be
executed.


!!! note
    Note that WSO2 Identity Server 5.5.0 onwards does not have a default
    implementation for request\_uri parameter.
    
    If you implement a `           CustomRequestObjectBuilder          ` to
    obtain Request Object from request\_uri, you need to register it as a
    new `           RequestObjectBuilder          `, in the
    `           $IS_HOME/repository/conf/deployment.toml         ` file
    
    ``` toml
    [oauth.oidc.custom_request_object_builder]]        
    type = "foo"
    class = "com.example.oauth.CustomRequestBuilder"
    ```
