# User Self Registration and Account confirmation via Mobile and Email Channels

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) supports self-registration to allow users
set up their account and receive confirmation when the account is
created.

When a user self-registers, the self-registration process creates the
user account and locks the account until the user confirms account
ownership via a confirmation mail or a SMS One Time Password(OTP) that WSO2 IS sends.



If a user does not confirm account ownership before the specified expiry
period, the user account is locked assuming that the expired account is
not owned by theÂ creator. If necessary, the system administrator can
delete such accounts to manage resources better.

!!! Note
    This feature is only available via the Self Registration and Account confirmation REST APis. 
    Currently, WSO2 IS does not support this feature via the End User Dashboard.

The following sections walk you through configuring and trying out
self-registration via SMS and Email Channels.
    
??? Warning "If you have migrated from a previous IS version"
    If you have migrated from a previous IS version, ensure that the `IdentityMgtEventListener` with the
    `         orderId=50        ` is set to **false** and that the Identity
    Listeners with `         orderId=95        ` and
    `         orderId=97        ` are set to **true** in the
    `         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml        ` file.
   
    !!! Note 
        You can skip this step if there are no entries for `event.default_listener.xxx`, in 
        the `deployment.toml` file.
    
    
    ``` java
    [event.default_listener.identity_mgt]
    priority= "50"
    enable = false
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_mgt]
    priority= "95"
    enable = true
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_store]
    priority= "97"
    enable = true
    ```
    
## Configuring self-registration

Follow the steps given below to register users for the super tenant,
which is `         carbon.super        `.

1.  Add the following properties to the `deployment.toml` file in the `IS_HOME/repository/conf` folder to 
configure the the identity server to send confirmation emails.
    
    !!! Note
        You need to add this configuration only if you wish to configure WSO2 IS to send confirmation 
        emails. Alternatively, you can use your own email managing mechanism.

    ``` toml
    [output_adapter.email]
    from_address= "wso2iamtest@gmail.com"
    username= "wso2iamtest"
    password= "Wso2@iam70"
    hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
    port= 587
    enable_start_tls= true
    enable_authentication= true
    ```    
    
2. Add the following properties to the `deployemnt.toml` to configure notification handling and 
self registration to support multiple notification channels.

    ```toml
    [identity_mgt.notification]
    default_notification_channel = "EMAIL"
    resolve_notification_channel = true
    
    [identity_mgt.user_self_registration]
    enable_account_lock_for_verified_preferred_channel = false
    enable_detailed_api_response = true
    ```    
    
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Property Name</th>
        <th>Functionality</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>default_notification_channel</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Default notification channel. If the user has not specified a notification channel
            user will be notified via the defined channel.</li>
            <div class="admonition warning">
                <p class="admonition-title">warning</p>
                <p>
                    Currently, WSO2 IS supports **SMS** and **EMAIL** as Internal Notification channels.
                    **DO NOT** change the values since they are case sensitive. Changing the case will
                    lead to Errors. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>By default this value is set to <code>EMAIL</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>resolve_notification_channel</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
        <li>Enable server to determine whether to send notifications via a SMS or an email.</li> 
        <li>Disabling this property would send notifications via the channel defined by 
        <code>default_notification_channel</code>.</li>
        </ul> 
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>enable_account_lock_for_verified_preferred_channel</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows a user to skip account confirmation if the user is already veirifed.</li>
            <div class="admonition warning">
                <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
                <p>
                    WSO2 recommends verifying users after self registration rather than 
                    using pre-verified user self registration. Therefore, it is recommended 
                    to set the property to <code>true</code>. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>enable_detailed_api_response</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable detailed API response body.</li> 
            <li>By default this value is set to <code>false</code>.</li>
        <ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

3.  Add an event publisher to `<IS_HOME/repository/deployment/server/eventpublishers`. For this 
sample, `http output adapter` is used. Following is a sample publisher to call a REST Service 
to send confirmation codes.

    ??? info "Sample Event Publisher"
        ```

            </to>
        </eventPublisher>
        ``` 
        
        !!! note
            This publisher uses NEXMO as the SMS REST service provider. For more information 
            on writing a custom http event publisher, see [HTTP Event Publisher](https://docs.wso2.com
            /display/DAS300/HTTP+Event+Publisher).

## Adding SMS notification templates

The email notification templates are stored in the `IS_HOME>/repository/conf/email/email-admin-config.xml` 
file and they can be edited using the Management Console.

!!! tip
    The **AccountConfirmation** template is used to send email notifications.You can edit and 
    customize the email template. For more information, 
    see [Customizing Automated Emails](../../learn/customizing-automated-emails).
    
The templates for SMS notifications are stored in the registry. Follow the steps below to add
SMS notification templates.

!!! Warning
    All the configurations are case sensitive. Changing the case may break the functionality and 
    cause errors.

1. Log in to the Management Console and click `Main> Registry> Browse`.

2. On the **tree view** tab, click `system -> config ->identity`.

3. Click **Add Collection**, enter `sms` as the **Name**, and then click **Add**.
    ![add-sms-collection](../assets/img/learn/self-registration/adding-sms-templates/add-sms-collection.png)
    
4. Click `sms` and then click **Add collection**. Enter `accountconfirmation` as the **Name**. 
This will create another directory inside the sms directory.
    ![add-accountconfirmation-collection](../assets/img/learn/self-registration/adding-sms-templates/add-accountconfirmation-collection.png)
    
5. Click on **Add Resource**.

6. Select `Create Text Content` as the **Method** and enter `en_us` as the **Name**.

7. Add the SMS notification template body. **NOTE:** Include `{{confirmation-code}}` placeholder 
in the SMS template body.

    ![add-template-resource](../assets/img/learn/self-registration/adding-sms-templates/add-template-resource.png)
8. Click `en_us` resource and add the following properties.
    ```text
    display : accountconfirmation
    type : accountconfirmation
    locale : en_US
    ```

## Configuring self-registration consent purposes
    
For more details see, 
[Configuring self-registration consent purposes](../.
./learn/self-registration-and-account-confirmation/#configuring-self-registration-consent-purposes).

## Try out self-registration  

WSO2 Identity Server provides the functionality to confirm the user account internally or externally.

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    Complete the steps given above before trying out self-registration.

1. **Internal Notification Management** : Notification sending for account confirmation is managed 
by WSO2 Identity Server.
    
2. **External Notification Management** : Notification sending and confirming the registration flow 
to WSO2 Identity Server is managed by an external notification management mechanism.

!!! note
    To configure external notification management, `disable` the property `Enable Notification 
    Internally Management` using the self registration configurations.
    
    ![external-notification-management-config](
    ../assets/img/learn/self-registration/external-notification-management-config.png)
    
### **Self Registration with Internal Notification Management** 


1. Use the following command to create a user self-registration request. 
    
    ``` tab="If the preferred channel is EMAIL" 
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": {"username": "kim","realm": "PRIMARY", "password": "Password12!","claims": [{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/givenname","value": "kim" },{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress","value": "kim.anderson@gmail.com"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/preferredChannel","value": "EMAIL"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/lastname","value": "Anderson"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile","value": "947721584558"} ] },"properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/me"
    ```
    
    ``` tab="If the Preferred channel is SMS" 
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": {"username":"kim","realm": "PRIMARY", "password": "Password12!","claims": [{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/givenname","value": "kim" },{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress","value": "kim.anderson@gmail.com"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/preferredChannel","value": "SMS"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/lastname","value": "Anderson"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile","value": "94774747551"} ] },"properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/me"
    ```
    
    !!! note
        For more information, see 
        [API Requests and Responses](.././learn/extended-self-registration-api-and-account-confirmation-api/#api-requests-and-responses).
   
2.  Following response will be returned by the API.

    ``` tab="Preferred channel as EMAIL" 
    {
        "code":"USR-02001",
        "message":"Successful user self registration. Pending account verification.",
        "notificationChannel":"EMAIL",
        "confirmationCode":null
    } 
    ```
    
    ``` tab="Preferred channel as SMS" 
    {
        "code":"USR-02001",
        "message":"Successful user self registration. Pending account verification.",
        "notificationChannel":"SMS",
        "confirmationCode":null
    } 
    ```
    
    !!! Note
        - If the preferred channel has not been specified in the request, the server will 
        decide which notification channel to use. If the `resolve_notification_channel` 
        property is set to `true`, the notification channel that was used will be returned 
        in the response with the `notificationChannel` parameter.
        
        - **NOTE:** If the above property is not enabled the user will be notified via 
        the channel specfied by `default_notification_channel` 
        proerty in `deployment.toml`.
        
        - For more information, see [Notification channel selection criteria](../.
        ./learn/extended-self-registration-api-and-account-confirmation-api/#notification-channel-selection-criteria).
        
3. If the notification channel is **EMAIL**, access the relevant email account and and click 
the button or the confirmation link. Then the user account will be unlocked.

    !!! Note
        If you have not provided a `callback` in the properties of the self registration 
        request, you will not be navigated to the user dashboard.
        
4. If the notification channel is **SMS**, the user will receive an OTP (One-Time-Password). 
Use the following command to confirm the user account.

    ```curl
    curl -k -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "code": "SBH3F3","properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/validate-code"
    ```
    
### **Self Registration with External Notification Management**

1. Use the following command to create a user self-registration request. 
    
    ``` tab="If the preferred channel is EMAIL" 
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": {"username": "kim","realm": "PRIMARY", "password": "Password12!","claims": [{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/givenname","value": "kim" },{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress","value": "kim.anderson@gmail.com"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/preferredChannel","value": "EMAIL"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/lastname","value": "Anderson"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile","value": "947721584558"} ] },"properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/me"
    ```
    
    ``` tab="If the Preferred channel is SMS" 
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": {"username":"kim","realm": "PRIMARY", "password": "Password12!","claims": [{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/givenname","value": "kim" },{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress","value": "kim.anderson@gmail.com"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/preferredChannel","value": "SMS"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/lastname","value": "Anderson"},{"uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile","value": "94774747551"} ] },"properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/me"
    ```
    !!! note
        For more information, see 
        [API Requests and Responses](.././learn/extended-self-registration-api-and-account-confirmation-api/#api-requests-and-responses).

2.  Following response will be returned by the API.     
    
    ```
    {
    "code":"USR-02002",
    "message":"Successful user self registration. Pending External verification.",
    "notificationChannel":"EXTERNAL",
    "confirmationCode":"64928c66-18c2-4092-923b-fb8ce10eeccc"
    }
    ```
   
    !!! note
        Note that a confirmation code has been returned by the API. This code needs to be used 
        to confirm the self registration flow.
        
3. Verify the user via an external mechanism.

4. To confirm the verification flow, use the following command.

    ```curl
    curl -k -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "code": "84325529-8aa7-4851-8751-5980a7f2d9f7","verifiedChannel":{"type":"SMS", "claim":"http://wso2.org/claims/mobile"},"properties": []}' "https://localhost:9443/api/identity/user/v1.0/validate-code"
    ```
    
    !!! note
        Note that you can specify the externally verified channel in the request by entering 
        the channel name and the value claim associated to it.
