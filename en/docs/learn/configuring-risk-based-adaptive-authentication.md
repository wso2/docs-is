# Configuring Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication

WSO2 Stream Processor (SP) is a lightweight, lean, streaming SQL-based
stream processing platform that allows you to collect events, analyze
them in real-time, identify patterns, map their impacts, and communicate
the results within milliseconds.  It is powered by
[Siddhi](https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-quckstart-4.0/)
to be extremely high performing.

This tutorial demonstrates using WSO2 Stream Processor to publish
transactional data and assess an end user's risk score based on the
user's transaction history in an adaptive authentication scenario.
Consider a business use case where a bank wants to prompt an additional
authentication step when a user attempts to log in to the system after a
doing a transaction of over $10,000.This usecase can be achieved by
creating a Siddhi application in WSO2 SP and configuring a conditional
authentication script in the service provider configuration of the WSO2
Identity Server (WSO2 IS).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the instructions given in the sections below to set this up.

### Risk profiling flow

The diagram below shows how the connection between the client
applications, WSO2 Stream Processor, and WSO2 Identity Server works to
assess risk and provide adaptive authentication to users.

![risk-based-adaptive-authentication](../assets/img/tutorials/risk-based-adaptive-authentication.png)

1.  The user performs bank transactions through different applications.
2.  Transactional data from all these applications are published to the
    WSO2 Stream Processor Analytics engine.
3.  The user attempts to access a service provider application that uses
    WSO2 IS as the identity provider.
4.  The service provider sends an authentication request to WSO2 IS.
5.  The user is prompted to log in and WSO2 IS authenticates the user
    using basic authentication (username/password credentials).
6.  WSO2 IS publishes an event to the Siddhi application in WSO2 SP,
    which computes the user's risk score based on the user's transaction
    history using the data received in step 2. If the user has made
    transactions that total to over $10,000 spent within the last five
    minutes, the risk score is 1. Else, the risk score is 0.
7.  If the risk score is 1, WSO2 IS prompts an additional step of
    authentication for the user (i.e., entering a hardware key number)
    before allowing the user to access the service provider application.

### Configuring WSO2 Stream Processor

First, create a Siddhi application as instructed below. The application
has two endpoints; one to publish transactional data, and the other to
get the user's risk score.

1.  Download the latest version of WSO2 Stream Processor.

2.  Create and deploy the following Siddhi application on a WSO2 SP
    worker node.  
    For more detailed instructions on how to create and deploy the
    Siddhi application, see [Using WSO2 Stream Processor for Adaptive
    Authentication](../../learn/using-wso2-stream-processor-for-adaptive-authentication).

    ``` java
    @App:name("RiskBasedLogin")
    @App:description("Description of the plan")

    @Source(type = 'http-request', source.id='testsource', basic.auth.enabled='true', parameters="'ciphers:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256', 'sslEnabledProtocols:TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2'", receiver.url="https://localhost:8280/RiskBasedLogin/InputStream", @map(type='json', @attributes(messageId='trp:messageId',username='$.event.username')))
    define stream InputStream (messageId string, username string);

    @sink(type='http-response', source.id='testsource', message.id='{{messageId}}', @map(type='json'))
    define stream OutputStream (messageId string, username string, riskScore int);

    define stream TempStream (messageId string, username string, sumTransactions double);

    @Source(type = 'http', receiver.url="http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream", basic.auth.enabled='false', @map(type='json', @attributes(username='$.event.username', transaction='$.event.transaction')))
    define stream TransactionInputStream (transaction double, username string);

    from TransactionInputStream#window.time(5 min)
    right outer join InputStream#window.length(1) unidirectional 
    on TransactionInputStream.username == InputStream.username
    select InputStream.messageId, InputStream.username, sum(transaction) as sumTransactions
    group by messageId, InputStream.username
    insert into TempStream;

    from TempStream
    select messageId, username, ifThenElse(sumTransactions > 10000, 1, 0) as riskScore
    insert into OutputStream;
    ```

### Configuring WSO2 Identity Server

Next, configure WSO2 IS to communicate with the Siddhi application.

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    
    -   Set up the service provider and sample application for adaptive
        authentication. For instructions on how to do this, see [Configuring
        a Service Provider for Adaptive Authentication](../../learn/configuring-a-service-provider-for-adaptive-authentication).
    -   For more information about adaptive authentication with WSO2
        Identity Server, see [Adaptive
        Authentication](../../learn/adaptive-authentication).
    

1.  Login to the management console and c reate a new user called "Alex"
    with login permission.
2.  Navigate to **Service Providers\>List** and click **Edit** on the
    [saml2-web-app-dispatch.com](http://saml2-web-app-dispatch.com)
    service provider.
3.  Expand the **Local and Outbound Configuration** section and click
    **Advanced Authentication**.
4.  Click on **Templates** on the right side of the **Script Based
    Conditional Authentication** field and then click **Risk-Based**.
    ![template-for-risk-based-authentication](../assets/img/tutorials/template-for-risk-based-authentication.png)
5.  Click **Ok**. The authentication script and authentication steps
    are configured. The authentication script defines a conditional step
    that executes the second step of authentication (the hardware key
    authenticator) if the `          riskScore         ` is greater
    than 0.
6.  The second authentication step that is added is
    `          totp.         ` However, `          totp         ` is an
    authentication step that you would normally use in production. To
    try out this scenario sample authenticators with the sample
    application, delete the `          totp         ` authenticator and
    add the following sample authenticator instead.  
    1.  Click **Delete** to remove the `            totp           `
        authenticator from Step 2 (the second authentication step).  
        ![second-step-risk-based-authentication](../assets/img/tutorials/second-step-risk-based-authentication.png)
    2.  Select **Sample Hardware Key Authenticator** and click
        **Add**.  
        ![sample-hardware-key-authenticator](../assets/img/tutorials/sample-hardware-key-authenticator.png)
        
7.  Save the service provider configurations.

8.  Restart WSO2 Identity Server.

### Trying it out

1.  Start the Tomcat server and a ccess the following sample PickUp
    application URL:
    <http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-dispatch.com> .
2.  Port offset the 9443 port in WSO2 Stream Processor. This is required
    because WSO2 IS also runs on the 9443 port.

    1.  Open the `             deployment.yaml            ` file found
        in the `             <SP_HOME>/conf/worker/            ` folder.

    2.  Change the `             Port: 9443            ` to
        **`              9444             `** under
        `             listenerConfigurations            ` .  

        ``` java
        listenerConfigurations:
          -
		   id: "default"
		   host: "0.0.0.0"
		   port: 9090
          -
           id: "msf4j-https"
           host: "0.0.0.0"
           port: 9444
		   scheme: https
	       keyStoreFile: "${carbon.home}/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks"
		   keyStorePassword: wso2carbon
		   certPass: wso2carbon
        ```

3.  Start the WSO2 SP server in a **Worker** profile.  
    -   For Windows: `            worker.bat           `
    -   For Linux: ./ `            worker.sh           `
4.  Log in by giving username and password credentials. You are logged
    in to the application.

    !!! note 
        The user is authenticated with basic authentication only.

5.  Log out of the application.

6.  Execute the following cURL command. This command publishes an event
    about a user bank transaction exceeding $10,000.

    !!! tip
    
        Replace the \<username\> tag in the cURL command given
        below with a valid username and ensure that the WSO2 SP Worker
        profile is running.
    

    ``` java
    curl -v -X POST   http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream   -H 'Accept: application/json'   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -H 'Postman-Token: 7847a682-012d-4939-88f5-6e8ec781c144'   -d '{    "event": {
            "username": "chris",
            "transaction": 12000
        }
    }' -v
    ```

7.  Log in to the sample PickUp application. You are prompted with the
    hardware key authentication after the basic authentication step.

    !!! info 
		Before executing the cURL command given in step 4, the user had no
		transaction history and the user's riskScore was 0. The
		authentication script is programmed to prompt only basic
		authentication if the risk score is 0.

		After executing the command, a transaction event that indicates the
		user spending more than $10,000 is published and recorded in the
		Siddhi application. Therefore, when the user now attempts to log in
		again, the user's riskScore is evaluated to 1 and the user is
		prompted for an extra step of authentication.

8.  Re-enter the number given on the screen and click **Sign In**. You
    are logged into the application.
