# Analyzing the Local Login Attempts

The **Local Login Attempts** statistical visualization displays
statistics relating to local authentication.

A local authentication is an authentication activity that is carried out
via a local identity provider.

An authentication sequence with a local identity provider involvement is
considered as a **single local authentication attempt** regardless of
the number of steps carried out by the local identity provider. In order
for a local authentication to be considered as successful, all the
constituent authentication steps carried out by the local identity
provider should be successful. However, failure of a single
authentication step is considered as a separate local authentication
failure.

The statistics displayed in this page include all thelocal
loginÂ attempts that are performed via local identity providers over time
as well as the local login attempts filtered based on service providers,
user stores, user roles, and users

Follow the steps below to view the **Local Login Attempts**.
