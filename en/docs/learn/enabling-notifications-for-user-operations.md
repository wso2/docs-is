# Enabling Notifications for User Operations

The primary objective of this is to send a notification to an external
endpoint once a user operation has taken place. For example, you want to
send an email to an email address once a new user is created or the
password of an existing user is changed. This can be achieved by
enabling notifications for user operations.

The configuration differs based on the type of notifications you want to
send to the external endpoint. The following instructions provide
information on how to send an email when a user operation takes place.

1.  Enable the email sending configurations of the WSO2 Identity Server
    as explained [here](../../setup/configuring-email-sending)
    
2.  Configure the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/msg-mgt.properties          `
    file with the desired destination configurations and template
    configurations. The following is a sample configuration for sending
    an email to an email address on user operation event.

    For example user operations can be account recovery, account
    locking/disabling, ask password.

    ``` java
    module.name.1=email
    email.subscription.1=userOperation
    email.subscription.userOperation.template=/home/user/Desktop/johnsmith (If you are using windows machine the path would be C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\johnsmith)
    email.subscription.userOperation.salutation=Admin
    email.subscription.userOperation.subject=User operation change information
    email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.1=privateMail
    email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.address=receiver@gmail.com
    email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.salutation=Admin private mail
    email.subscription.userOperation.endpoint.privateMail.subject=User operation change information to private mail
    ```

    <td>The first subscription by the email module is ' <code>               userOperation              </code> '. When a user operation happens, an event is triggered from the system. From this configuration you can make the email module to subscribe for that particular event and send an email on events. You can define this subscription name as <code>               userOperation              </code> (you must use this since this is the name of the event that is published by the publishing party) and from this point onwards you will be using <code>               email.subscription.userOperation              </code> as the prefix for properties relevant to this subscription.</td>
