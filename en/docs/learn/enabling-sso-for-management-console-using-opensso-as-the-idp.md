# Enabling SSO for Management Console using OpenSSO as the IDP

This page includes the information about enabling single sign-on for
management console using OpenSSO as the IDP.

### Prerequisites

1.  Download and install OpenAM/OpenSSO. (Download the .war file from
    [here](https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/) )

    !!! info "Installing OpenAM"
		See
		[here](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openam/12/getting-started/#install-openam)
		for instructions on how to install OpenAM.

2.  Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/) and [run
    it](../../setup/running-the-product).

WSO2 Identity Server comes with SAML web-SSO authenticators. This page
focuses on the steps necessary for its configuration.

!!! info 
	It is not necessary to introduce third party .jars into the server
	environment since WSO2 products pack all the necessary .jars that deal
	with SAML token parsing.

### Setting up the Environment

#### Configuring OpenSSO

OpenSSO provides two options to register a service provider:

1.  Creating an SP fedlet.
2.  Setting up an SP using a meta file called **sp.xml**.

This section focuses on the latter approach. Use the following steps to
configure OpenSSO:

1.  Create **sp.xml** file.

    ??? note "Sample sp.xml"

		``` java
		<EntityDescriptor entityID="https://localhost:9443/acs" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">
			<SPSSODescriptor AuthnRequestsSigned="false" WantAssertionsSigned="false"  protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
				<SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
									Location="https://localhost:9443/acs/fedletSloRedirect"
									ResponseLocation="https://localhost:9443/acs/fedletSloRedirect"/>
				<SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
									Location="https://localhost:9443/acs/fedletSloPOST"
									ResponseLocation="https://localhost:9443/acs/fedletSloPOST"/>
				<SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP"
									Location="https://localhost:9443/acs/fedletSloSoap"/>
				<NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</NameIDFormat>
				<AssertionConsumerService isDefault="true" index="0" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
										Location="https://localhost:9443/acs"/>
				<AssertionConsumerService index="1" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact"
										Location="https://localhost:9443/acs"/>
			</SPSSODescriptor>
			<RoleDescriptor xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
							xmlns:query="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:ext:query"
							xsi:type="query:AttributeQueryDescriptorType"
							protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"></RoleDescriptor>
			<XACMLAuthzDecisionQueryDescriptor WantAssertionsSigned="false"
							protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"></XACMLAuthzDecisionQueryDescriptor>
		</EntityDescriptor>
		```

    !!! note
    
        -   The given **sp.xml** sample file uses
            `                         https://localhost:9443/acs                       `
            as the redirection URL. Configure it according to your
            environment:
            `            https://<carbonserverhot:port>/acs           ` .
        -   The `            EntityID           ` element of the **sp.xml**
            should match the corresponding value of
            `       service_provider_id        ` in the
            deployment.toml file.
        -   The same values are used in single logout related parameters.
            However this is not tested in the single logout feature with
            OpenSSO at the time of writing.
    

2.  Go to **Common Tasks** \> **Register Remote Service Provider** and
    upload the file.  
    1.  Select **sp.xml** as the file to upload.
    2.  Select a **Circle of Trust** configuration in the remote service
        provider.
3.  Go to **Federation** \> **Entity Providers** in the OpenSSO
    management console and select the newly registered service provider.
4.  Select the response signing attribute.  
    ![response-signing-attribute](../../assets/img/tutorials/response-signing-attribute.png)
    
5.  Under the **NameID** **Format** list, make sure you specify the ‘
    **transient** ’ and ‘ **unspecified** ’ **Name ID** **Formats**.  
    ![nameid-format-list](../../assets/img/tutorials/nameid-format-list.png)

#### Setting up the WSO2 product

-   Open the <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml file and add the following configuration.

    ``` xml
    [admin_console.authenticator.saml_sso_authenticator]
	enable=true
    ```

    Change the following parameters accordingly:

    -   `            ServiceProvideID           ` - This can be any
        identifier and does not have to be a URL. However, the
        configured value should be equal to the value configured in the
        **sp.xml** file.
        
    -   `            IdentityProviderSSOServiceURL           ` - This is
        the URL of your IDP.
        
    -   `            idpCertAlias           ` - This is the certificate
        that gets used during response validation from the IDP. OpenSSO
        servers’ public key should be imported to the Carbon servers
        keystore with the alias name ‘opensso’.

### Exporting/Importing certificates

Add the public key of the selected circle of trust in to the Carbon
keystore ( **wso2carbon.jks** ) found under
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks        `.
You can use Java keytool to do that.

#### Exporting a public key

Here we use the default shipped OpenSSO keystore certificate. It has the
alias name of ‘ **test** ’ and typically located in
`         /home/opensso/opensso/keystore.jks        ` . The default
password is ‘ **changeit** ’. To export the public key of ‘ **test** ’,
use the following command:

``` java
keytool -export -keystore keystore.jks -alias test -file test.cer
```

The public key is stored in the ‘ **test.cer** ’ file. You can view the
certificate content with the following command:

``` java
keytool -printcert -file test.cer
```

#### Importing a public key

Now import the ‘ **test.cer** ’ into Carbon key stores found under
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks        `
. The following command does this:

``` java
keytool -import -alias opensso -file test.cer -keystore wso2carbon.jks
```

View the imported certificate using the following command:

``` java
keytool -list -alias opensso -keystore wso2carbon.jks -storepass wso2carbon
```

### Testing the environment

Try accessing the Carbon management console (e.g.,
`                   https://localhost:9443/carbon                 ` ).
This redirects you to the IDP (OpenSSO login page). Enter your username
and password in the OpenSSO login page. Once you are properly
authenticated, you are redirected back to the WSO2 Carbon product home
page as a logged in user.

The authenticated user has to be in the Carbon servers’ user-store for
authorization (permission) purposes. Since the above described test
environment does not share the same user store between IDP (OpenSSO
server) and SP (Carbon server), create a user with the same name in the
Carbon server user store. Otherwise there is an authorization failure
during the server login.
