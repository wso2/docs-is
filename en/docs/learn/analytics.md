# Analytics

WSO2 Identity Server Analytics allows you to view and analyze statistics
related to authentication requests that go through WSO2 Identity Server.
You can configure WSO2 Identity Server to publish authentication related
events to WSO2 Identity Server Analytics so that you view and analyze
the following:

-   **Login analytics** : Includes statistics related to login attempts
    made via WSO2 Identity Server.

    The latest version of WSO2 Identity Server Analytics allows you to
    view and analyze statistics of login attempts made through the
    authentication framework of WSO2 Identity Server. You cannot view
    statistics related to admin console login attempts and grant types
    such as password.

-   **Session analytics** : Includes statistics related to specific
    sessions that get created for different applications accessed via
    WSO2 Identity Server.

    A session is the time duration between a successful log on and the
    subsequent log off by a specific user.
