# Self-Registration

Self-registration is an [account management](../../learn/managing-user-accounts) feature offered by WSO2 Identity Server. 

In this approach, when a user self-registers, a user account gets created and an email requesting for account confirmation is send to the user's registerd email ID. The account remains locked for a predefined duration during which the user should confirm the account creation. If the user does not confirm the account creation before the predefined duration, the user account gets locked. Such accounts can be deleted by administrators to manage resources effectively.

## Scenario

**Pickup** is a cab company that has many employees who use different credentials to sign in to different internal enterprise applications. While **Robert** is an administrator at Pickup, **Mark** is a new recruit who wishes to use the self-registration option to create a user account. 

When Mark self-registers, an email requesting for account creation confirmation is sent to Mark's registered email account. Mark should respond to the confirmation email before the confirmation acceptance window expires. If Mark fails to confirm the account creation, his user account will be locked and Robert will be able to delete his user account.

Let's learn how it's done!  

## Set up
Follow the steps below to configure WSO2 Identity Server to enable password entry for account confirmation.


1.	Open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

	1. 	Make sure the following listener configs are in place.

		```
		[event.default_listener.identity_mgt]
		priority= "50"
		enable = false
		[event.default_listener.governance_identity_mgt]
		priority= "95"
		enable = true
		[event.default_listener.governance_identity_store]
		priority= "97"
		enable = true
		```

	2.	To send user account creation confirmation email, add the following configurations. 

		```toml
		[identity_mgt.user_onboarding]
		enable_email_verification = true 
		lock_on_creation=true
		```

	3.	To configure the email server to send emails requesting a password entry, add the following configurations.

		-	**from_address**: This is the email address from which the confirmation email will be sent.
		-	**username**: This is the user name of the given email address.
		-	**password**: This is the password of the given email address. 

		```toml tab="Format"
		[output_adapter.email]
		from_address= ""
		username= ""
		password= ""
		hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
		port= 587
		enable_start_tls= true
		enable_authentication= true
		```

		```toml tab="Sample"
		[output_adapter.email]
		from_address= "wso2iamtest@gmail.com"
		username= "wso2iamtest"
		password= "Wso2@iam70"
		hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
		port= 587
		enable_start_tls= true
		enable_authentication= true
		```
