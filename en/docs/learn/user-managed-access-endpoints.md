# User Managed Access Endpoints

This section describes the different endpoints used by User Managed
Access.

### Resource registration endpoint

This endpoint allows the resource server to place resources under the
protection of the authorization server on behalf of the resource owner.
The resource server uses a RESTful API resource registration endpoint at
the authorization server to create, read, update, and delete resource
descriptions and list all resources. The resource description consists
of JSON documents that are maintained as web resources. In the normal
process, protection of a resource starts with successful registration
and ends with successful deregistration.

##### Resource description

The figure below shows the flow of the request made by the
resource server to the authorization server (01) and response generated
by authorization server to the resource server (02).

![uma-resource-registration-endpoint]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/uma-resource-registration-endpoint.png) 

Resource description is a JSON object which explains the characteristics
of the resource that is to be put under the protection of the
authorization server.

Given below is an example of the resource description.

``` java
{  
   "resource_scopes":[  
      "view",
      "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/print"
   ],
   "description":"Collection of digital photographs",
   "icon_uri":"http://www.example.com/icons/flower.png",
   "name":"Photo Album",
   "type":"http://www.example.com/rsrcs/photoalbum"
}
```

The resource description has the following parameters:

| Parameter                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Mandatory/Optional |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `             resource_scopes            ` | A plain string, a URI, or an array of strings which indicates the available scopes for the resource.                                                                                                                                                           | Mandatory          |
| `             name            `            | A human-readable string naming the resource. The authorization server can use the referenced icon in the user interface when presenting information to a resource owner.                                                                                       | Mandatory          |
| `             description            `     | A human-readable string describing the resource in detail. The authorization server can use this description in the user interface when presenting information to a resource owner.                                                                            | Optional           |
| `             icon_uri            `        | A URI for a graphic icon representing the resource. The authorization server can use the referenced icon in the user interface when presenting information to a resource owner.                                                                                | Optional           |
| `             type            `            | A string identifying the semantics of the resource. The authorization server can use this information when processing information about the resource or displaying information about it in the user interface when presenting information to a resource owner. | Optional           |

##### Resource registration APIs

The authorization server **must** support the following five
registration options. You need a valid Protection API Access Token (PAT)
to access them. Here, `         resourceregistration        ` stands for
the resource registration endpoint and `         _id        ` stands for
the authorization server-assigned identifier for the web resource
corresponding to the resource at the time it was created, included
within the URL returned in the location header.

The following five operations can be performed from this endpoint:

| HTTP method                       | Description                      | URI                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `             POST            `   | Create the resource description. | `             resourceregistration/resource            `     |
| `             GET            `    | Read the resource description.   | `             resourceregistration/resource/_id            ` |
| `             PUT            `    | Update the resource description. | `             resourceregistration/resource/_id            ` |
| `             DELETE            ` | Delete the resource description. | `             resourceregistration/resource/_id            ` |
| `             GET            `    | List the resource descriptions.  | `             resourceregistration/            `             |

##### Error messages

When the request to the resource registration endpoint is incorrect, the
authorization server responds as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 14%" />
<col style="width: 85%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Error Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>HTTP 404 (Not Found)</td>
<td><p>If the referenced resource cannot be found, the authorization server <strong>must</strong> respond with an HTTP 404 status code and <strong>may</strong> respond with a <code>              not_found             </code> error code.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed)</td>
<td><p>If the resource server request used an unsupported HTTP method, the authorization server <strong>must</strong> respond with the HTTP 405 status code and <strong>may</strong> respond with an <code>              unsupported_method_type             </code> error code.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>HTTP 400 (Bad Request)</td>
<td><p>If the request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed, the authorization server <strong>must</strong> respond with the HTTP 400 status code and <strong>may</strong> respond with an <code>              invalid_request             </code> error code.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##### Creating a resource description

The create resource operation adds a new resource to the authorization
server using the POST method.

**Request**

``` xml
POST : https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/resourceregistration/v1.0/resource HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 8ff019ba-4f8e-3ed9-9b13-a077d9d04557
...
{  
   "resource_scopes":[  
      "read-public",
      "post-updates",
      "read-private",
      "http://www.example.com/scopes/all"
   ],
   "icon_uri":"http://www.example.com/icons/photoAlbem.png",
   "name":"PhotoAlbem",
   "type":"http://www.example.com/rsrcs/socialstream/140-compatible"
}
```

If the request is successful, the resource is registered in the
authorization server and the 201 (Created) status message which includes
a location header and a `         _id        ` parameter is returned.

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /resource/2292d2f5-df72-4c2e-a918-5ae18b900855
...
{  
   "_id":"2292d2f5-df72-4c2e-a918-5ae18b900855",
   "user_access_policy_uri":"http://as.example.com/rs/222/resource/KX3A-39WE/policy"
}
```

##### Reading a resource description

This operation reads the previously registered resource description
using the GET method.

**Request**

``` xml
GET: https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/resourceregistration/v1.0/resource/2292d2f5-df72-4c2e-a918-5ae18b900855 
HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Authorization: Bearer 8ff019ba-4f8e-3ed9-9b13-a077d9d04557
```

If the request is successful, the response returns the 200 (OK) status
message with a body that contains the referenced resource description
along with a `         _id        ` parameter.

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

   "name":"PhotoAlbem",
   "type":"http://www.example.com/rsrcs/socialstream/140-compatible"
}
```

##### Updating a resource description

This operation updates the resource description. It replaces the
previous description with the new description using the PUT method.

**Request**

``` xml
PUT : https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/resourceregistration/v1.0/resource/
2292d2f5-df72-4c2e-a918-5ae18b900855 HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 8ff019ba-4f8e-3ed9-9b13-a077d9d04557
...
{  
   "resource_scopes":[  
      "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/view",
      "public-read"
   ],
   "description":"Collection of digital photographs",
   "icon_uri":"http://www.example.com/icons/nature.png",
   "name":"Photo Album 90",
   "type":"http://www.example.com/rsrcs/photoalbum90"
}
```

If the request is successful, it returns 200 (OK) as the response from
the authorization server and it includes the `         _id        `
parameter.

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{  
   "_id":"2292d2f5-df72-4c2e-a918-5ae18b900855"
}
```

##### Deleting a resource description

This operation removed a previously registered resource and its
information.

HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Authorization: Bearer 8ff019ba-4f8e-3ed9-9b13-a077d9d04557
```

If the request is successful, the authorization server responds with an
HTTP 200 or 204 status message.

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1 204 No content
...
```

##### Listing a resource descriptions

This operation lists down all the resources of a specific resource owner
using the GET method.

]
```

### Permission endpoint

The permission endpoint of the authorization server is used by the
resource server to request permissions on behalf of the client. This
process is initiated when a client makes a tokenless resource request or
a request with an invalid token to the resource server. The resource
server interprets the request made to the client and maps it to the
relevant authorization server, resource owner, resource identifiers, and
their corresponding set of scopes. Note that in a single instance, the
resource server can only request permission to access the resources of a
single resource owner that is protected by a single authorization
server. The resource server decides whether to request zero or more
scopes corresponding to a resource identifier.  
  
The diagram given below illustrates a request made to the permission
endpoint with a success response in return.

<a name="errormsgs"></a>
##### Error messages

The error code can either be `         invalid_resource_id        ` or
`         invalid_resource_scope        ` .

| Error code                                        | Description                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `             Invalid_resource_id            `    | This indicates that the resource ID does not exist in the authorization server.                                        |
| `             Invalid_resource_scope            ` | This indicates that at least one of the scopes corresponding to the resource is not found at the authorization server. |

<a name="permissionticket"></a>
##### Creating a permission ticket

This creates a permission ticket using the POST HTTP method.  A sample
request made by the resource server to the authorization server is shown
below:

**Request**

``` xml
POST https://localhost:9443/api/identity/oauth2/uma/permission/v1.0/permission 
Content-Type:  application/json
Authorization: Bearer 8ff019ba-4f8e-3ed9-9b13-a077d9d04557
...
[
   {
      "resource_id":"238157ba-06f4-4730-8492-86e35f5b2b7d",
      "resource_scopes":[
         "view",
         "crop",
         "lightbox"
      ]
   },
   {
      "resource_id":"238157ba-06f4-4730-8492-86e35f8b2b32",
      "resource_scopes":[
         "view",
         "layout",
         "print"
      ]
   },
   {
      "resource_id":"238157ba-06f4-8676-8492-86e35f5b2b7d",
      "resource_scopes":[
         "http://www.example.com/scopes/all"
      ]
   }
]
```

The Protection API Access Token (PAT) provided in the request header is
used by the authorization server to identify the relevant resource owner
and resource server. If the permission request is successful, then the
authorization server sends a permission ticket in the success response
as shown below:

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1          201     Created
Content-Type:  application/json
...
{                           
  "ticket":"016f84e8-f9b9-11e0-bd6f-0021cc6004de"
}
```

You would get a response similar to what is shown below, if the
permission request is authenticated successfully, but fails due to some
other reason.

**Response**

``` xml
HTTP/1.1          400     Bad    Request
Content-Type:  application/json
...
{
   "error":"invalid_resource_id",
   "error_description":"Permission request failed with bad resource ID."
}
```
