# Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

### Recommended use

The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases
where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the client (e.g.,
a service’s own mobile client) and in situations where the client can
obtain the resource owner’s credentials.

### The flow

Instead of redirecting the user to the authorization server, the client
itself will ask the user for the resource owner's username and password.
The client will then send these credentials to the authorization server
along with the client’s own credentials.

The diagram below illustrates the resource owner password credentials
grant flow.
