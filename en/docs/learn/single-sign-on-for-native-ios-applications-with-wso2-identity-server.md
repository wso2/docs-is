# Single Sign-On for Native iOS Applications with WSO2 Identity Server

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to
access multiple applications using the same set of credentials. With
SSO, a user can provide credentials once and gain access to different
applications without having to sign in to each application individually.

You can add SSO capability to your iOS based native client applications
using WSO2 Identity Server as an identity provider.

This tutorial demonstrates how you can add SSO support to a sample iOS
application using WSO2 Identity Server as the Identity Provider.

### Prerequisites

Before you start the tutorial, be sure to complete the following
prerequisites:

-   Set up a MacOS based computer to try out the tutorial.
-   Download and install WSO2 Identity Server, which will act as the
    identity provider in the tutorial. You can download the product
    installer from
    [here](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/install/),
    and run it.
-   Download or clone the [WSO2 Identity Server samples
    repository](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is).
-   Download and install Xcode 9+ to work with the iOS client app
    sample.

!!! tip
    
    It is useful to have basic knowledge in iOS application development and
    some experience with the SWIFT (3+) programming language.
    

Once you have the prerequisites, you can follow the step-by-step
instructions in the following sections.

### Setting up WSO2 Identity Server

Since WSO2 Identity Server acts as the identity provider in this
tutorial, first you need to configure WSO2 Identity Server as an
identity provider.

!!! Info
    
    Let’s refer to the WSO2 Identity Server installation location as
    `         <IS_HOME>        ` throughout the tutorial.
    

Before you begin, you need to set up a valid SSL certificate in WSO2
Identity Server. This is important because by default iOS applications
are restricted from communicating with a source that does not have a
valid certificate. However, if you are running the server locally and
you want to test the sample application via the iOS simulator, you can
add a self-signed certificate to both WSO2 Identity Server and the
simulator.

1.  Follow the steps
    [here](../../administer/creating-new-keystores#adding-ca-signed-certificate-to-keystores)
    to add a self-signed certificate to WSO2 Identity Server.

    !!! note
    
        If you are running WSO2 Identity Server locally, you can add a local
        DNS entry to a custom domain name and generate self-signed
        certificates to that particular domain. If you are doing this, you
        also need to [change the WSO2 Identity Server
        host](../../setup/running-the-product#accessing-the-management-console)
        accordingly and add the local DNS entry to your hosts file.
    

2.  Start WSO2 Identity Server and access the management console. You
    can sign in using `          admin         ` as the username and
    password. For detailed instructions on accessing the management
    console of WSO2 Identity Server, see [Accessing the Management
    Console](../../setup/running-the-product#accessing-the-management-console).
3.  On the **Main** tab of the management console, go to **Identity**
    -\> **Service Provider** and click **Add**.
4.  Enter an appropriate name for the new service provider and click
    **Register**.
5.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, and
    then expand the **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Configuration.**
6.  Click **Configure** and set the following values in addition to the
    values that are set by default:
    1.  Specify `            wso2issample://oauth           ` as the
        **Callback Url**. This is the sample application’s URL.
    2.  Select **PKCE Mandatory**. This is recommended because you need
        to adhere to the PKCE protocol as a best practice when
        developing native mobile applications.
    3.  Select **Allow authentication without the client secret**.
        This allows the native mobile application to bypass the
        authentication phase. For information on how native applications
        should interact with an authorization endpoint, see [OAuth 2.0
        for native apps
        specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252).
7.  Click **Add**. You will see an information message that says
    **Application registered successfully**.
8.  Click **OK**.
9.  Make a note of the generated **OAuth Client Key**. You need this
    value when you set up the sample application.

Now you have set up WSO2 Identity Server. Next you need to set up the
sample iOS application.

### Setting up the sample application

1.  Use [this tool](https://github.com/yageek/iostrust) to import a
    self-signed certificate to the iOS simulator.

2.  Go to the downloaded WSO2 Identity Server samples repository. Let’s
    refer to the samples repository directory location as
    `           <SAMPLES_HOME>          ` throughout this tutorial.

3.  Open the
    `           <SAMPLES_HOME>/oidc-client-app-samples/ios-client-app-sample/WSO2-IS-SampleApp.xcworkspace          `
    file in Xcode.

    !!! note
    
        Note
    
        Ensure that you do not open the
        `           <SAMPLES_HOME>/oidc-client-app-samples/ios-client-app-sample/           WSO2-IS-SampleApp.xcodeproj          `
        file as it will not resolve the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
        dependencies.
    

Following is the directory structure of the sample application project:

![sample-app-directory-structure](../../assets/img/tutorials/sample-app-directory-structure.png)

Following are descriptions of the key components of the sample
application project:

-   `          AppDelegate.swift         ` - The default delegation
    class to observe changes of the sample application state.
-   `          Main.storyboard         ` - The main storyboard of the
    sample application.
-   `          Info.plist         ` -  Contains all the essential
    details about the sample application.
-   `          Config.plist         ` - The configuration file that
    contains identity provider details along with the OAuth client ID.
-   `          controllers         ` directory - Contains controllers
    for the login view and profile view.
-   `          model         ` directory - Contains model data objects.
-   `          mgt         ` directory - Contains management classes.
-   `          utils         ` directory - Contains utility classes.
-   `          resources         ` directory - Contains the resource
    files used in the application.
-   `          service         ` directory - Contains the service class
    that handles the OAuth communication. We will take a look at the
    purpose of this directory in detail later in the tutorial.

Now that you are familiar with the key components of the sample project,
let's set up the dependencies and third party libraries that are
required.

-   The sample client application uses
    [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) as the dependency manager in the
    project and the dependencies are defined in the pods file. In this
    tutorial you do not need to install the dependencies because the
    dependencies are already included along with the sample application
    source code.

    !!! note
    
        If you are using your own sample application, you have to navigate
        to the project root folder and run the following command to install
        dependencies:
    
        ``` java
        pod install
        ```


-   The sample client application project uses
    [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS) as the third party
    library for OAuth 2.0 communication between the client and server.
    The AppAuth library is added as a dependency in the pod file.

    !!! note
    
        The sample client application uses the [dev-logout development
        branch](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/tree/dev-logout) of
        the AppAuth for iOS library due to several logout functionality
        issues in the master branch. Therefore, you will see the following
        line in the pods file:
    
        ``` java
        pod 'AppAuth', :git => 'https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS.git', :branch => 'dev-logout'
        ```
    
        The [dev-logout development
        branch](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/tree/dev-logout) can
        get removed or merged in the future. If that happens, you can
        replace the above line with the following to import the standard
        AppAuth library from the master branch:
    
        ``` java
        pod 'AppAuth'
        ```
        
        **Note:** Since there are ongoing discussions about the issues and
        complexities exposed by the AppAuth for iOS library, the recommended
        approach is to use the dependencies that are already included in the
        sample source code. Installing dependencies from scratch is not
        recommended until the issues and complexities are resolved.
        

### Configuring the sample application

There are two key configuration steps that you need to perform before
you run the application.

##### Configuring application settings

To configure application settings, right click on the
`         <SAMPLES_HOME>/oidc-client-app-samples/ios-client-app-sample/WSO2-IS-SampleApp/Info.plist        `
file and open it with a source code editor.

-   In the source code, you will see the following lines of code:

    ``` java
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
            <string>wso2is.local</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>wso2issample</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </array>
    ```

    Here, the `           CFBundleURLTypes          ` property specifies
    the URL scheme of the application. The URL scheme defines the manner
    in which applications communicate with each other. The sample
    application uses a custom URL scheme called
    `           wso2issample          `.

    This is why you had to specify
    `           wso2issample://oauth          ` as the callback URL when
    you created the OAuth service provider in the Setting up WSO2
    Identity Server section. When authentication is done, users are
    redirected to the sample application through the
    `           wso2issample://oauth          ` URL.

    !!! info
    
        You can register any URL scheme that you want by defining it as
        above. If you are running WSO2 Identity Server locally, you must
        appropriately configure endpoints and OAuth client settings to
        successfully test the application.
    

-   You will also see the following lines of code:

    ``` java
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    ```

    The above code block specifies that you allow the application to
    connect to sources with untrusted certificates. You can only use the
    above code block in a test environment.

    !!! warning
    
        It is not recommended to connect to sources with untrusted
        certificates in a production environment. Therefore, be sure to
        remove the above code block before you publish your application for
        review.
    

##### Configuring endpoints and OAuth client settings

To configure endpoint and OAuth client settings, right click on the
`         <SAMPLES_HOME>/oidc-client-app-samples/ios-client-app-sample/WSO2-IS-SampleApp/Config.plist        `
file and open it with a source code editor.

-   In the source code, you will see several OAuth related properties
    defined as follows:

    ``` java
    <dict>
        <key>IssuerURL</key>
        <string>https://localhost:9443</string>
        <key>LogOutURL</key>
        <string>https://localhost:9443/oidc/logout</string>
        <key>UserInfoURL</key>
        <string>https://localhost:9443/oauth2/userinfo?schema=openid</string>
        <key>TokenURL</key>
        <string>https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token</string>
        <key>AuthURL</key>
        <string>https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize</string>
        <key>RedirectURL</key>
        <string>wso2issample://oauth</string>
        <key>ClientID</key>
        <string>[YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]</string>
    </dict>
    ```

    The first few properties are endpoints of the WSO2 Identity Server
    OAuth API. You can replace these values depending on your WSO2
    Identity Server setup.

    -   The `             RedirectURL            ` should be the same
        URL that you specified as the callback URL when you created the
        OAuth service provider in the Setting up WSO2 Identity
        Server section.

    -   The `             ClientID            ` should be the OAuth
        client ID that you obtained in the Setting up WSO2 Identity
        Server section.

        !!! info
        
                You do not need to specify the client secret anywhere in the
                code because this sample application is considered as a public
                client that cannot securely keep the client secret.
        

Now you are ready to try out the sample application.

### Running the sample application

Follow the steps below to use the iOS simulator and run the sample
application:

1.  Open the
    `           <SAMPLES_HOME>/oidc-client-app-samples/ios-client-app-sample/WSO2-IS-SampleApp.xcworkspace          `
    file in Xcode. You may already have this file open in Xcode if you
    followed the steps in the Setting up the iOS client sample
    application section.

2.  Click **Run** on the Xcode toolbar to build the sample application and
    run it via the simulator. This will launch the sample application in
    the simulator.  
    ![pickup-login](../../assets/img/tutorials/pickup-login.png)

3.  Click **LOGIN**. You will see the following message on the
    screen:  
    ![confirm-pickup-login](../../assets/img/tutorials/confirm-pickup-login.png)

4.  Click **Continue**. You will be redirected to the sign-in screen so
    that you can sign-in via WSO2 Identity Server.  
    ![sign-in](../../assets/img/tutorials/sign-in-via-identity-server.png)

5.  Enter your credentials and click **SIGN IN**. This will take you to
    the consent screen.  
    ![oidc-claims-approval](../../assets/img/tutorials/oidc-claims-approval.png)

6.  Select a required approval mechanism, then select the attributes you
    want to share with the service provider, and then click **Continue**
    to allow the sample application access your information. This will
    redirect you to the sample application profile screen that displays
    your user name and a **Sign out** button.  
    ![pickup-welcome-screen](../../assets/img/tutorials/pickup-welcome-screen.png)

Now you have successfully signed in to the sample application using WSO2
Identity Server as an identity provider.

Next, you can try signing out of the sample application to understand
the complete SSO authentication experience provided by WSO2 Identity
Server for native iOS applications.

Follow the steps below to sign out of the sample application:

1.  On the sample application profile screen, click **Sign out**. You
    will see the following message on the screen:  
      
    ![confirm-pickup-signout](../../assets/img/tutorials/confirm-pickup-signout.png)

2.  Click **Yes**. This will sign you out from the sample application.
    You will also see a message as follows notifying that you are going
    to be redirected to a page to log out of WSO2 Identity Server.  
    ![pickup-logout-redirection-notice](../../assets/img/tutorials/pickup-logout-redirection-notice.png)

3.  Click **Ok**. You will see a message as follows:

    !!! warning "Important"
    
        -   The following message displays the identity provider name as
            `            (null)           `. This happens when you run WSO2
            Identity Server in your local machine and use a host entry to
            resolve DNS.
        -   The message says `            Sign In           ` although you
            are performing a log out action This is due to a known iOS
            application log out issue. For more information on this known
            issue, see the [Apple developer
            forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/91647).  
            However, you can continue to log out of the application.
    

    ![pickup-logout-signin-error](../../assets/img/tutorials/pickup-logout-signin-error.png)

4.  Click **Continue**. This will redirect you to the OpenID Connect
    logout page of WSO2 Identity Server. Once you click ‘Yes’ you will
    be logged out from the server and will be redirected to the login
    page of the application.

    ![oidc-logout](../../assets/img/tutorials/oidc-logout.png)

5.  Click **Yes**. This will log you out from the server and will
    redirect you to the sign-in page of the sample application.

    !!! note
    
        -   If you do not log out from WSO2 Identity Server and the
            application is not cleared from memory, you can access the
            sample application without providing credentials. This is
            possible because the cookies set by the server are not cleared
            from the application side.
        -   If you sign in to the sample application and then close the
            application, clear it from memory and try to log out, you will
            not be able to perform external log out from the server side
            because cookie data will not be available. This is a result of
            not having a proper mechanism to persist cookie data due to a
            [known iOS application log out
            issue](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/91647).
    
        The issues mentioned above are unresolved issues in the AppAuth for
        iOS library. There are no workarounds for these issues at the moment
        because Apple does not allow access to the Safari view controllers
        cookie storage. For more information on the issues, see the
        following:
    
        -   <https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/91647>
        -   <https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/pull/259>
        -   <https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/255#issuecomment-412645235>
    

Now that you understand how to add SSO capability to an iOS application,
you can implement your own iOS application and configure SSO for the
application using WSO2 Identity Server as the identity provider.
