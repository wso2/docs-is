# Configuring the Realm

User management functionality is provided by default in all WSO2
Carbon-based products. The following documentation explains the
configurations that should be done in WSO2 products in order to set up
the User Management module.

The complete functionality and contents of the User Management module is
called a **user** **realm**. The realm includes the user management
classes, configurations and repositories that store information.
Therefore, configuring the User Management functionality in a WSO2
product involves setting up the relevant repositories and updating the
relevant configuration files.

The following diagram illustrates the required configurations and
repositories:
