# Handling Custom Claims with the JWT Bearer Grant Type

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) allows you to handle custom claims in a
self contained access token with the JWT bearer grant type.

!!! tip
    
    Following are a few important points to keep in mind when you want to
    use WSO2 Identity Server to handle custom claims in a self contained
    access token with the JWT bearer grant type:
    
    -   Both
        `       enable_oidc_dialect        `
        and `          enable_unmapped_user_attributes         ` are elements
        that are configured under the `          [oauth.oidc.claims]         `
        group in the `          deployment.toml         ` file, and are
        considered to be `          false         ` by default.
    -   When the
        `         enable_oidc_dialect         `
        element is set to `          false         ` in the
        `          deployment.toml         ` file or is not configured in the `deployment.toml` file at all, this means that all custom claims coming
        with a JWT assertion are copied to the self contained access token.
    -   When the
        `          enable_oidc_dialect        `
        element is set to `          true         ` in the
        `          deployment.toml         ` file, claims are handled in the
        default OIDC flow. This means that claims are converted to OIDC
        dialect depending on service provider and Identity provider level
        claim mappings, and also based on claims configured in OIDC registry
        path. Only the claims that are specified in the
        `          openid         ` scope are copied to the self contained
        access token.
    -   If you want to copy the attributes that do not have a mapping, you
        need to add the `           enable_unmapped_user_attributes          `
        element as follows under the `           [oauth.oidc.claims]         `
        group in the `           deployment.toml          ` file:
    
        ``` toml       
            [oauth.oidc.claims]
            enable_oidc_dialect= true
            enable_unmapped_user_attributes= true
    ```


Let's take a look at how you can use WSO2 Identity Server to handle
custom claims in a self contained access token with the JWT bearer grant
type depending on the server level configurations at the time of calling
the token endpoint with the JWT bearer grant type. For this, let's use
two instances of WSO2 Identity Server, where one instance acts as a
federated identity provider, and the other acts as the service provider.
Let’s call the WSO2 Identity Server instance that acts as the identity
provider as IS-IP, and the other instance as IS-SP.

Before you begin

Follow the steps below to set up the two WSO2 Identity Server instances:

1.  [Download](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/) and
    [install](../../setup/installing-the-product) two Identity Server instances.
2.  Add the following configuration to the `<IS-IP_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and set the value to 1. This is done to increment the port value of IS-IP so that
    there is no port conflict with IS-SP.

    ``` toml
    [server]
    offset = "1"
    ```

Now that you have set up the Identity Server instances, you can proceed
with the configuration steps.

### Configuring IS-IP and IS-SP

-   Follow the steps below to configure IS-IP to generate a JWT token by
    using the password grant type and passing the scope as openid.
    1.  Open the
        `             <IS-IP_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml           `
        file and add the following entry.

        ``` toml
        [oauth.token_generation]
        access_token_type= "self_contained"
        ```

    2.  Restart IS-IP.
    3.  Configure an [OAuth service
        provider](../../using-wso2-identity-server/adding-and-configuring-a-service-provider).
    4.  Initiate an access token request to IS-IP over a known [grant
        type](../../using-wso2-identity-server/oauth-2.0-grant-types). The following cURL command
        illustrates the syntax of an access token request that can be
        initiated using the [Resource Owner Password
        Credential](../../using-wso2-identity-server/resource-owner-password-credentials-grant) grant
        type, and specifying the scope as openid. For more information,
        see [Configuring WSO2 Identity Server to issue self-contained
        access
        tokens](Self-contained-Access-Tokens_103329628.html#Self-containedAccessTokens-config)
        .

        <table>

        <li>Copy the <strong>OAuth Client Secret</strong> as the value for <code>                      &lt;CLIENT_SECRET&gt;                     </code> .</li>

        <li>By default, <code>                    &lt;IS_HTTPS_PORT&gt;                   </code> has been set to 9443. However, in this scenario since the port offset for IS-IP is incremented by <code>                    1                   </code>, the default port value needs to be incremented by <code>                    1                   </code> .</li>
        </ul>
        </div></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

          
        Let's assume that the request sent is as follows:

        ``` java
        curl -u q4h7UhUyt0wC8A2Awu_kfmxEpr0a:vlTwUeCAyYPRzkeayJpmdW0xfxAa -k -d "grant_type=password&username=megala&password=megala" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:9444/oauth2/token?scope=openid
        ```

        Then the self contained JWT access token that returns
        in response to the request would be as follows:

        ``` java
        eyJ4NXQiOiJOVEF4Wm1NeE5ETXlaRGczTVRVMVpHTTBNekV6T0RKaFpXSTRORE5sWkRVMU9HRmtOakZpTVEiLCJraWQiOiJOVEF4Wm1NeE5ETXlaRGczTVRVMVpHTTBNekV6T0RKaFpXSTRORE5sWkRVMU9HRmtOakZpTVEiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJjb3VudHJ5IjoiU3JpIExhbmthIiwic3ViIjoibWVnYWxhQGNhcmJvbi5zdXBlciIsImF1ZCI6WyJxNGg3VWhVeXQwd0M4QTJBd3Vfa2ZteEVwcjBhIl0sImF6cCI6InE0aDdVaFV5dDB3QzhBMkF3dV9rZm14RXByMGEiLCJzY29wZSI6Im9wZW5pZCIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOlwvXC9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6OTQ0NFwvb2F1dGgyXC90b2tlbiIsImV4cCI6MTUyODA5ODE1OCwiaWF0IjoxNTI4MDk0NTU4LCJlbWFpbCI6Im1lZ2FsYUB3c28yLmNvbSIsImp0aSI6IjIyMjMyNDZhLWI5MmUtNDMwNC1iYmY1LTE3MzExNTU3Y2FmNSJ9.c-WKt87FL24WAy24E2mp2uusPJAR2aDZDujqKkVlM5yDjUQ9hYvDX96KTo4ew1j9LGIb8cN9npX5NK-DtLeNHNuR1ypKhcyQ9Gwsqp42wEswH_IMHVRxERv5X0giz8rH-z7LGo2IGmGjLjhfGXP9C-_1r00krtkCTZpWPmUTW1BneFEEVF-WLaNmjC28CUdTcVealZOD9ByA44WTiA-nUmAp2j1zWb7K-rDm0cMaJ_ucYsnObmDovKyT-7y02zutBNm5plfn2cQbsLo0cAzWmTtdpX5gXmqtJHANRXwM8LriVJMTG7nDU5zDcU4GRYz5aWPQn3RgTA4donzpPvPYQw
        ```

        When you use a JWT decoder to decode the access token, you can
        see the following payload:

        ``` java
        {
          "country": "Sri Lanka",
          "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
          "aud": [
            "q4h7UhUyt0wC8A2Awu_kfmxEpr0a"
          ],
          "azp": "q4h7UhUyt0wC8A2Awu_kfmxEpr0a",
          "scope": "openid",
          "iss": "https://localhost:9444/oauth2/token",
          "exp": 1528098158,
          "iat": 1528094558,
          "email": "megala@wso2.com",
          "jti": "2223246a-b92e-4304-bbf5-17311557caf5"
        }
        ```

        Here, the `             country            ` and
        `             email            ` are custom claims related to
        the user.

-   Follow the steps below to configure IS-IP as the identity provider
    in IS-SP.
    1.  Sign in to the management console of IS-SP. For detailed
        instructions on starting the management console, see [Getting
        Started with the Management
        Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console).
    2.  On the **Main** tab, go to **Identity** -\> **Identity
        Providers**, and click **Add**.
    3.  Provide appropriate values to configure IS-IP as the identity
        provider. For detailed instructions on how to add a new identity
        provider, see [Adding and Configuring an Identity
        Provider](../../using-wso2-identity-server/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider).
    4.  Click **Register**.

Now that you have configured IS-IP and IS-SP, let's take a look at how
WSO2 Identity Server handles custom claims with the JWT bearer grant
type depending on the server level configurations at the time of calling
the token endpoint with the JWT bearer grant type.

### Calling the token endpoint with JWT bearer grant type

#### Scenario 1

First, let's take a look at how WSO2 Identity Server handles custom
claims with the JWT bearer grant type when the
`        enable_oidc_dialect        ` element is set to
`         false        ` in the `         deployment.toml       ` file.

-   Send the following sample request to call the token endpoint:

    ``` java
    curl -i -X POST -u EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa:LpElcqthcTOqilN1K_zAHf48fL4a -k -d 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=<jwt_assertion>' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token?scope=openid
    ```

    You will see the following payload when you use a JWT decoder and
    decode the JWT token:

    ``` java
    {
      "country": "Sri Lanka",
      "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
      "aud": [
        "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa"
      ],
      "azp": "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa",
      "scope": "openid",
      "iss": "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token",
      "exp": 1528098158,
      "iat": 1528096102,
      "email": "megala@wso2.com",
      "jti": "243702fe-8087-49c2-a439-f6dc7258021a"
    }
    ```

    You will see that the `           country          ` and
    `           email          ` are directly copied to the generated
    JWT token.

Here, the `         country        ` and `         email        ` are
directly copied to the generated JWT token because the
`         enable_oidc_dialect        ` element is set to
`         false        `, which results in all custom claims coming
from incoming JWT assertions  being directly copied to the generated JWT
token.

#### Scenario 2

Now, let's take a look at how WSO2 Identity Server handles custom claims
with the JWT bearer grant type when the
`         enable_oidc_dialect= true        ` element is set to
`         true        ` and the
`         enable_unmapped_user_attributes        ` element is set to
`         false        ` in the `         deployment.toml        ` file.

-   **Sub-scenario 1** : In this scenario, if we consider a sub-scenario
    assuming that identity provider claim mappings and service provider
    requested claims are empty. You will see the following payload when
    you use a JWT decoder and decode the JWT token:

    ``` java
    {
      "country": "Sri Lanka",
      "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
      "aud": [
        "q4h7UhUyt0wC8A2Awu_kfmxEpr0a"
      ],
      "azp": "q4h7UhUyt0wC8A2Awu_kfmxEpr0a",
      "scope": "openid",
      "iss": "https://localhost:9444/oauth2/token",
      "exp": 1528100688,
      "iat": 1528097088,
      "email": "megala@wso2.com",
      "jti": "d90bb7f4-25ce-466c-8ea8-8eb6f6624992"
    }
    ```

    You will see that this is similar to scenario 1. This means that
    when there are missing claim mappings in the identity provider level
    and service provider level, all custom claims are directly copied to
    the generated JWT token.

      

      

-   **Sub-scenario 2** : If we consider a sub-scenario assuming that an
    identity provider claim mapping exists, whereas a service provider
    requested claim mapping does not exist. Then you will see the
    following payload when you use a JWT decoder and decode the JWT
    token:

    ``` java
    {
      "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
      "aud": [
        "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa"
      ],
      "azp": "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa",
      "scope": "openid",
      "iss": "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token",
      "exp": 1528100688,
      "iat": 1528097449,
      "jti": "528dd371-df53-46a5-8276-62271eae53d4"
    }
    ```

      
    This scenario is considered as a user configuration error from WSO2
    Identity Server point of view. In such a scenario, none of the
    custom claims are passed with the self contained access token.

  

-   **Sub-scenario 3** : If we consider a sub-scenario assuming that
    identity provider claim mappings and service provider requested
    claim mappings exist. For example, assume you do the following in
    your local set up:

<!-- -->

-   1.  Map the
        `                         http://wso2.org/claims/country                       `
        local claim to `            customclaim           ` in the OIDC
        dialect. ![custom-claim-country](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/custom-claim-country.png) 
    2.  Add the `            customclaim           ` to the openid
        scope.  
        ![oidc-custom-claim-scope]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/oidc-custom-claim-scope.png) 
    3.  Add the following identity provider mapping.  
        ![claim-config-custom-claims]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/claim-config-custom-claims.png) 
    4.  Add following service provider requested claim.  
        ![claim-config2-custom-claims]( ../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/claim-config2-custom-claims.png)

Then you will see the following payload when you use a JWT decoder and
decode the JWT token:

``` java
{
  "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
  "aud": [
    "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa"
  ],
  "azp": "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa",
  "scope": "openid",
  "iss": "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token",
  "customclaim": "Sri Lanka",
  "exp": 1528100688,
  "iat": 1528098298,
  "jti": "2e355311-f96d-4028-ae8a-edec5bfdf7a8"
}
```

Here, you can see that `         customclaim        ` is added to the
generated token. This is added based on the claim mapping in the
identity provider and service provider level, and the OIDC claim mapping
configuration. Since the `         email        ` does not have any
claim mapping in the identity provider level, it is not added to the
generated token.

In this scenario, all incoming claims go through the mapping process and
are filtered according to the scope.Then the relevant claims are sent
back with the self contained token.

#### Scenario 3

Let's take a look at how WSO2 Identity Server handles custom claims with
the JWT bearer grant type when both
`         enable_oidc_dialect        ` and
`         enable_unmapped_user_attributes        ` elements are set to
`         true        ` in the `         deployment.toml        ` file.

You will see the following payload when you use a JWT decoder and decode
the JWT token:

``` java
{
  "sub": "megala@carbon.super",
  "aud": [
    "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa"
  ],
  "azp": "EcvBCz8CDWFdALzavlakTTKkSPUa",
  "scope": "openid",
  "iss": "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token",
  "customclaim": "Sri Lanka",
  "exp": 1528102874,
  "iat": 1528099309,
  "email": "megala@wso2.com",
  "jti": "031902cd-a624-4d11-ba70-335bc9edbcb2"
}
```

You will see that the incoming JWT contains the
`         country        ` as a `         customclaim        ` and that
`         email        ` is directly copied.

Here, `         country        ` is converted to
`         customclaim        ` because it has claim mappings.
`         email        ` does not have any claim mapping, hence it is
directly copied to the generated token .
