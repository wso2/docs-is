# Configuring Federated Authentication

This topic includes information on how to configure federated
authenticators in WSO2 Identity Server.

!!! Info "Before you begin"
	For more information on what federated authenticators are, see [Outbound/federated authenticators in the Identity Server architecture](../../get-started/architecture#outbound/federated-authenticators).

To navigate to the federated authenticators configuration section, do the following.

1. Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the [Management Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console). 

2. Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu. Click Add under Identity Providers. 
For more information, see [Adding and Configuring an Identity Provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider).  

3. Fill in the details in the **Basic Information** section. 

!!! warning
    
    OpenID 2.0 has been removed from the base product as it is now
    an obsolete specification and has been superseded by OpenID Connect. We
    recommend using [OpenID Connect](../../learn/configuring-oauth2-openid-connect)
    instead.
    

You can configure the following federated authenticators by expanding
the **Federated Authenticators** section followed by the required
subsections.

!!! tip "More Federated Authenticators"
    
    Some authenticators such as LinkedIn are not provided OOTB with WSO2
    Identity Server but can be downloaded from the [WSO2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/) and plugged in to work with WSO2
    IS. For more information on those authenticators and connectors, see the
    [WSO2 Identity Server Connectors documentation](../../develop/authenticators-and-connectors).
