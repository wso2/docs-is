# Validating the Scope of OAuth Access Tokens using XACML Policies

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) allows you to validate the scope of an
OAuth access token using XACML policies to provide fine-grained access
control to APIs.

If you want the XACML scope validator to execute after checking the
validity of the access token in an OAuth access token validation flow,
you can select the scope validator as XACML when you configure a service
provider. This provides fine-grained access control to APIs.

The following sections walk you through the basic steps
you need to follow to validate the scope of OAuth access tokens using
XACML policies:

### Configure the service provider

Follow the steps below to configure a service provider in WSO2 Identity
Server so that the authentication happens as expected. For more
information on how the service provider fits into the WSO2 IS
architecture, see [Architecture](../../get-started/architecture).

1.  Start WSO2 Identity Server and access the Management Console via
    <https://localhost:9443/carbon/> .

2.  On the **Main** tab, navigate to **Service Providers**\> **Add**
    under the **Identity** menu, and enter a name for the service
    provider.

3.  Click **Register**. This adds a new service provider.

4.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, then
    expand the **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Configuration**, and then click
    **Configure**. This displays the **Register New Application**
    screen.

5.  Specify required values for the fields. When you specify values, be
    sure to select **XACML Scope Validator** as the scope validator.

6.  Click **Add**. This registers the new application.

7.  Click **Update**. This updates the service provider with details of
    the OAuth/OpenID connect configurations that you specified.

Now that you have configured the service provider, the next step is to
configure the XACML policy to validate the XACML scope during OAuth
token validation.

### Set up the policy

Follow the instructions below to publish a policy using a XACML policy
template that is available by default with WSO2 IS:

1.  In the **Main** tab of the Management Console, navigate to
    **PAP** \> **Policy Administration** under the **Entitlement** menu.
    For more information on Policy Administration Point (PAP), see
    [Configuring the Policy Administration
    Point](../../tutorials/configuring-the-policy-administration-point).
    
2.  Select the
    `                       scope_based_token_validation_policy_template                     `
    policy, and click **Edit** to view the selected policy in the policy
    editor.

    !!! info
		XACML template policies provide a pre-configured template with place
		holders to customize the policy depending on your requirement.

3.  Edit the policy to customize it depending on your requirement. You
    can change the values of attributes and rules.

4.  Click **Save Policy** to save the changes. You can see the policy
    that you created on the policy list (the original policy template
    remains unchanged)

5.  Click the link **Publish to My PDP** corresponding to the new
    policy.
6.  On the UI that appears, leave the default values as they are and
    click **Publish**.

    !!! note
    
        For more information on Publishing a XACML policy, see
        [here](../../tutorials/publishing-a-xacml-policy).
    

    To ensure that the policy has been published successfully, click on
    **Policy View** under the **Entitlement \> PDP** section on the
    **Main** tab of the management consol, and check if the created
    policy is listed.

Now that you have created the policy and enforced it using the policy
template, you can test the policy to evaluate whether XACML scope is
validated at the time of OAuth token validation.

### Try it out

Follow the steps below to try out the policy using the XACML TryIt tool:

!!! tip
    
    The XACML TryIt tool allows you to test policies easily without having
    to create and send authorization requests to WSO2 IS. It is a tool
    through which authorization requests can be created and evaluated
    against available policies. You can write simple XACML 3.0 requests in
    XML format and try them using the web UI of the TryIt tool
    

1.  On the Management Console, click **Tools**, and then click
    **TryIt** under the **XACML** section.
    
2.  Click **Create Request Using Editor**.  
    ![create-request-using-editor](../../assets/img/tutorials/create-request-using-editor.png)
    
3.  Specify the following as the sample request:

    ``` java
    <Request xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17" CombinedDecision="false" ReturnPolicyIdList="false">
       <Attributes Category="http://wso2.org/identity/identity-action">
           <Attribute AttributeId="http://wso2.org/identity/identity-action/action-name" IncludeInResult="false">
               <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">token_validation</AttributeValue>
           </Attribute>
       </Attributes>
       <Attributes Category="http://wso2.org/identity/sp">
           <Attribute AttributeId="http://wso2.org/identity/sp/sp-name" IncludeInResult="false">
               <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">test_server</AttributeValue>
           </Attribute>
       </Attributes>
       <Attributes Category="http://wso2.org/identity/oauth-scope">
           <Attribute AttributeId="http://wso2.org/identity/oauth-scope/scope-name" IncludeInResult="true">
               <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">SCOPE_1</AttributeValue>
           </Attribute>
       </Attributes>
    </Request>
    ```

4.  Click **Evaluate With PDP**. You will see a response message that
    says either `          Permit         ` or `          Deny         `
    depending on whether the XACML scope is validated or not at the time
    of OAuth token validation.
