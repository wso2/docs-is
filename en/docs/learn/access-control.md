# Access Control

Access control is a way of limiting access to a system or to physical or
virtual resources. In computing, access control is a process by which
users are granted access and certain privileges to systems, resources or
information. In older access control systems, users must present
credentials before they can be granted access. In current physical
systems, these credentials may come in many forms, but these credentials
that cannot be transferred in order to provide a heavy security.

Entitlement management is the process granting privileges to resources
or users, after fine-grained authentication for controlling access of
users. XACML is an [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org) standard that
describes both a policy language and an access control decision
request/response language (both written in XML).
