# Writing a Post-Authentication Handler

WSO2 Identity Server authentication framework facilitates you with the
pluggable architecture of multiple inbound/outbound protocols as well as
local and federated authenticators including a large number of extension
points. The Post Authentication Handler is one such extension point
which allows you to do a task upon successful authentication.
Authentication to the system is only successful once the execution of
post-authentication handlers is completed. The following handlers are
examples of post-authentication handlers that are available by default.

-   **Application authorization handler** - Once the user successfully
    authenticates to a service provider, this authorization handler will
    check whether the given user is entitled to login by evaluating a
    xacml policy. This happens during authorization.  
      
-   **Missing mandatory claim handler** - When mandatory claims are
    configured in a service provider under claim configurations, the
    user is prompted to fill in mandatory claim values if the values are
    not already known at the point of authentication.  
      
-   **Consent handler / disclaimer dialog** - This handler requests for
    either consent or disclaimer approval. Once the authentication steps
    are completed, the user is prompted for consent or disclaimer
    approval and the user is only able to proceed once it is accepted or
    approved.

### Writing a post-authentication handler

Writing a custom post-authentication handler is fairly simple. For a
sample implementation consisting of the disclaimer dialog, see the
[sample post-authentication
handler](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/tree/master/etc/sample-post-authentication-handler)
. Follow the instructions on the readme to try it out.

Extend the
`         org.wso2.carbon.identity.application.authentication.framework.handler.request.AbstractPostAuthnHandler        `
to write a custom handler. This allows you to enable/disable or change
the priority of this handler via configurations in
`         identity.        ` xml configuration file. The
post-authentication handler interface consists of a single main method
which you need to implement in order to implement a post-authentication
handler.

``` java
PostAuthnHandlerFlowStatus handle(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest,

    HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse,

    AuthenticationContext authenticationContext)

throws PostAuthenticationFailedException;
```

The post-authentication operations can be done within the implementation
of this handler. The response can be coveyed on the interface using one
of the following two methods.  
  
##### By returning a PostAuthnHandlerFlowStatus

This method of returning the response can have multiple flow statuses:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Status</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SUCCESS_COMPLETED</td>
<td>This status can be returned if the post-authentication process is complete. The next post handler is then invoked as the current one has been completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>INCOMPLETE</td>
<td><p>This status indicates that the post-authentication process is incomplete (e.g., a redirection to an external page). The response can be simply redirected and you can expect it to come back to your post-authentication handler once the response is submitted to WSO2 IS again.</p>
<p>If a response from an external page is submitted to the post-authentication handler which is in progress, the following needs to be included in the request along with the input data that is recieved from the external page:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>SessionDataKey</p></li>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The 'sessionDataKey' query parameter is used to coordinate the request state across components participating in the request flow. It does not correlate with the user session. Furthermore, the request state maintained against the 'sessionDataKey' parameter value is cleared by each participating component at the end of request flow. This means that even if an external party grabs the 'sessionDataKey' they will not be able to get into the authentication sequence, as the user session is not associated with that key.</p>
</div>
<li><p>PASTR cookie (this is used to track the post-authentication sequence and used to secure the post-authentication flow.)</p></li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As seen in the sample implementation, the disclaimer page is redirected
and it stores the “consentPoppedUp” state so that next time the post
handler continues upon the response, it can look for the disclaimer
response and proceed.  
  

##### By throwing a PostAuthenticationFailedException 

A post-authentication exception along with an error code and message can
be thrown if you wish to break the login flow or do not need to continue
the login flow. The error code will be displayed in an error page. For
example, this exception can be used for failing a login attempt due to
an authorization failure.

Follow the steps given in the [sample post-authentication handler
readme](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/blob/master/etc/sample-post-authentication-handler/README.MD)
to install this sample and get it working with WSO2 Identity Server. You
can enable and disable this newly written handler using the
configuration shown below in the
`          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity.xml         ` . You can
also change the execution order using the `          orderId         `
parameter. The handler with the lesser value for the
`          orderId         ` parameter will be executed first.

``` xml
<EventListener type="org.wso2.carbon.identity.core.handler.AbstractIdentityHandler" name="org.wso2.carbon.identity.post.authn.handler.disclaimer.DisclaimerPostAuthenticationHandler
" orderId="899" enable="true" />
```

!!! note
    
    **Note:** These configurations will not be effective if the
    `          getPriority         ` and `          isEnable         `
    methods of your post authentication handler are overridden.
