# Adding Users and Roles

User management involves defining and managing users, roles, and access levels in a system. A typical user management implementation involves a wide range of functionality such as adding/deleting users, controlling user activity through permissions, and managing user roles.  

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a new user, create a role with a set of permissions, and then log in to the WSO2 Identity Server dashboard using the newly created user's credentials. 

## Scenario

Pickup is a cab company that has many employees. Each of these employees have a particular designation such as "Manager", "Driver" etc., and depending on their designation within the company, they will have different permissions and access levels. 

To achieve this, Pickup's administrator can create user roles for each designation and specify the required permissions for each. Then, the admin can add a user account for each of the employees and assign them to a user role such as "Manager" role according to their respective designations. 

## Set up

1. [Download WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/).

2. Navigate to `<IS_HOME>/bin` and start the server by executing one of the following commands.

    ``` java tab="Linux/MacOS"
    sh wso2server.sh
    ```

    ``` java tab="Windows"
    wso2server.bat run
    ```

3. Access the [WSO2 Identity Server Management Console] (https://localhost:9443/carbon) as an administrator (credentials: admin/admin).

## Try it out

1. Create two new users named "Cameron" and "Alex".

2. Create a new role named "Manager" with `Login` permission and assign the user Alex to this role. 

3. Navigate to the following URL on a new browser window to access the WSO2 Identity Server dashboard: https://localhost:9443/dashboard

4. Log in using the credentials for Alex's user account. Note that you are successfully logged in.

5. Now log out and attempt to log in using Cameron's credentials. Note that login is not successful. This is because Cameron is not assigned to a role with `Login` permission.
