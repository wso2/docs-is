# Logging in to Salesforce with Facebook

This topic provides instructions on how to log into Salesforce using
your Facebook credentials. In this use case Salesforce is the service
provider while Facebook is the Identity Provider. If a user needs to log
in to Salesforce, WSO2 Identity Server sends the user details to
Facebook. Facebook authenticates the user credentials and if the user
exits in Facebook, the user is allowed to log in to Salesforce.

!!! tip "Before you begin!"  
    When you log into Salesforce, you normally use an email address. So, to
    integrate this with the Identity Server, you need to configure WSO2 IS
    to enable users to log in using their email addresses.
    
    ??? note "Click here to get the steps on how configure the email address as the username."
    
    		
    	!!! note
			Configuring the email address as the username in an **already running
			Identity Server** is not the production recommended way. Therefore,
			**make sure to configure it before you begin working with WSO2 IS**.
        

		1.  Open the \<
			`              PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml             `
			file.
		2.  Look for the commented out configuration
			`               EnableEmailUserName              ` . Uncomment the
			configuration to enable email authentication.

			``` html/xml
			<EnableEmailUserName>true</EnableEmailUserName>
			```

		3.  Open the \<
			`               IS_HOME>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml              `
			file and configure the `               AttributeID              `
			property of the
			`                               http://wso2.org/claims/username                             `
			claim ID that is under
			`               <Dialect dialectURI="                               http://wso2.org/claims                              ">              `
			to `               mail              ` .

			``` java
			<Claim>
			   <ClaimURI>http://wso2.org/claims/username</ClaimURI>
			   <DisplayName>Username</DisplayName>
			   <AttributeID>mail</AttributeID>
			   <Description>Username</Description>
			</Claim>
			```

			!!! note
	
				This file is checked only when WSO2 IS is starting for the first
				time. Therefore, if you haven't configured this property at the time
				of starting up the server for the first time, you will get errors at
				the start up.
	

		4.  Open the `               <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/              `
			`               identity/                               identity-mgt.properties               `
			file and set the following property to
			`               true              ` .

			!!! info 
				This step is required due to a known issue that prevents the
				confirmation codes from being removed after they are used when email
				usernames are enabled. This occurs because the '@' character (and
				some special characters) are not allowed in the registry. To
				overcome this issue, enable hashed usernames when saving the
				confirmation codes by configuring the properties below.

			``` xml
			UserInfoRecovery.UseHashedUserNames=true
			```

			Optionally, you can also configure the following property to
			determine which hash algorithm to use.

			``` xml
				UserInfoRecovery.UsernameHashAlg=SHA-1
			```

		5.  Configure the following set of parameters in the user store
			configuration, depending on the type of user store you are connected
			to (LDAP/Active Directory/ JDBC).

10. Click **Save** to save your configurations.

11. Search for My Domain in the search bar that is on the left
    navigation pane and click **My Domain**.
    
12. Go to **Domain Management** in the left navigation pane and click
    **My Domain**.  
    ![domain-management](../../assets/img/tutorials/domain-management.png)
    
13. Click **Deploy to Users**. Click **Ok** to the confirmation message
    that appears.
    
14. In the page that appears, you must configure the **Authentication
    Configuration** section. Scroll down to this section and click
    **Edit**.  
    ![edit-authentication-configuration](../../assets/img/tutorials/edit-authentication-configuration.png)
    
15. Under **Authentication Service** , select **SSO** and deselect
    **Login Page**.  
    ![select-sso-in-authentication-service](../../assets/img/tutorials/select-sso-in-authentication-service.png)

    !!! info
		SSO is the SAML user authentication method you created in
		salesforce.com, in [step 9
		above](../../learn/logging-in-to-salesforce-with-facebook#samlsinglesignon). It is
		configured to direct users to WSO2 Identity server, which in turn
		direct the request to Facebook as Facebook acts as the IdP.

    2.  Select the **Define Custom Claim Dialect** option under **Select
        Claim mapping Dialect**.
    3.  Click **Add Claim URI** to add custom claim mappings as
        follows.  
        Add the following claim URIs.

        | Service Provider Claim | Local Claim                                                                                                                                    |
        |------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | email                  | `                                                      http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress                                                   ` |
        | first\_name            | `                                   http://wso2.org/claims/givenname                                 `                                         |
        | last\_name             | `                                   http://wso2.org/claims/lastname                                 `                                          |

    4.  <a name="LoggingintoSalesforcewithFacebook-subject-claim-id"></a>Select all of these claims as **Requested Claims**.  
        Select **email** from the **Subject Claim URI** dropdown. The
        **Subject Claim URI** is important to define as it is the unique
        value used to identify the user. In cases where you have a user
        store connected to the Identity Server, this **Subject Claim
        URI** value is used to search for the user in the user store.  
        ![email-from-subject-claim-uri](../../assets/img/tutorials/email-from-subject-claim-uri.png)
        
        For more information about claim mapping, see [Claim
        Management](../../learn/claim-management).

6.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** and the **SAML2
    Web SSO Configuration** and click **Configure**.

8.  Click **Register** to save your configurations.

### Configuring the Facebook application

1.  Go to <https://developers.facebook.com/> and log in using your
    Facebook credentials.
    
2.  Click on **Create App**.  
    ![create-app-facebook](../../assets/img/tutorials/create-app-facebook.png)
    
3.  Enter a **Display Name**, Contact Email, and click **Create App
    ID**.  
    ![create-app-id](../../assets/img/tutorials/create-app-id.png)
    
4.  Enter code for security check, and click **Submit**.

5.  On Select product page, click **Set up** under **Facebook Login**
    .  
    ![setup-facebook](../../assets/img/tutorials/setup-facebook.png)
    
6.  Select **Website** as the platform for the app used in this
    sample.  
    ![select-website-as-the-platform](../../assets/img/tutorials/select-website-as-the-platform.png)
    
7.  Enter **`             https://localhost:9443/            `** as the
    Site URL and click **Save**.
	
	!!! info 
		If you have configured [WSO2 Identity Server to run using the IP or
		hostname](../../setup/running-the-product#change-ip-or-hostname)
		, you need to provide the IP or hostname instead of
		`             localhost            ` .

    ![enter-site-url](../../assets/img/tutorials/enter-site-url.png)

8.  Under Products on the left navigation panel, Click **Facebook
    Login**.

9.  You can configure the **Client OAuth Settings** on the window that
    appears.  
    ![client-oauth-setting](../../assets/img/tutorials/client-oauth-setting.png)

    1.  **Client OAuth Login** should be set to **Yes**.  
        Client OAuth Login is the global on-off switch for using OAuth
        client token flows. It helps to secure your application and
        prevent abuse by locking down which token redirect URIs are
        allowed.
    2.  **Web OAuth Login** should be set to **Yes**.  
        Web OAuth Login settings enables any OAuth client token flows
        that use the Facebook web login dialog to return tokens to your
        own website.
    3.  **Valid OAuth redirect URIs** should be set to
        `                                             https://localhost:9443/commonauth                                          `
        .  
        Enter the ACS URL (Assertion Consumer URL) which is the endpoint
        in WSO2 Identity Server which accepts the response sent by
        facebook.

10. Scroll down and click **Save Changes** button to save the changes.

11. Click on **Dashboard.** You can see the **App ID** and **App
    Secret** as shown in the image below. Click **Show** to view the
    **App Secret**.

    !!! info 
		**App ID** is the Client ID and the **App Secret** is the Client
		Secret in OAuth terminology. The API Version is Facebook’s API that
		is used to create the application.

    ![id-secret-for-facebook](../../assets/img/tutorials/id-secret-for-facebook.png)

12. Click **Settings** on the left menu and navigate to the **Basic**
    tab. Add the **App Domains** (since WSO2 IS is running on localhost,
    you can add localhost as the App Domain)

13. Click **Save Changes**.

Now you have finished configuring Facebook as an Identity Provider.

!!! info "About accessing the app"

	The app is not available to general public yet. To make to app available
	to every Facebook user, you have to submit the app for review. After a
	review, Facebook makes the app available to every Facebook user. You can
	find more information on the review process by clicking on **App
	Review** in the left navigation menu of your app's dashboard.

	The review process may take some time, so for the purposes of this
	sample, you can specify some Facebook users as Developers or Testers.
	Only the users specified here can use this app to log in with Facebook
	until the app goes public. To do this, click on **Roles** in the left
	navigation menu of the dashboard and specify the required Facebook users
	as Developers or Testers.

	![submit-fb-app-for-review](../../assets/img/tutorials/submit-fb-app-for-review.png)

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by adding Facebook as a
new identity provider.

1.  Log in to the management console as an administrator.

2.  In the **Identity** section under the **Main** tab of the management
    console, click **Add** under **Identity Providers**.
    
3.  Give a suitable name as the **Identity Provider Name**. In this
    case we can have Facebook as the identity provider name for clarity.

	!!! info 
		For detailed information on the Identity Provider configurations,
		see [Adding and Configuring an Identity
		Provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider).

4.  Choose the salesforce certificate you downloaded in [step8 under
    Configuring Salesforce](#salesforce-step8) for
    **Identity Provider Public Certificate**.
    
5.  Configuring claim mapping for Facebook:

    1.  Expand **Claim Configuration**, go to **Basic Claim
        Configuration**.
    2.  Select the **Define Custom Claim Dialect** option under **Select
        Claim mapping Dialect**.
    3.  Click **Add Claim Mapping** to add custom claim mappings as
        follows.  
        ![add-claim-mapping-for-facebook](../../assets/img/tutorials/add-claim-mapping-for-facebook.png)

        Do the following mappings as shown in the above image.

        | Identity Provider Claim URI | Local Claim URI                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
        |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | email                       | `                                   http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress                                 ` | Here we map the value in Facebook with the claim URI in the Identity Server. In this case it is a direct correlation of claims where the email attribute of Facebook users is mapped to the email attribute used in the Identity Server.           |
        | first\_name                 | `                                   http://wso2.org/claims/givenname                                 `    | Here we map the value in Facebook with the claim URI in the Identity Server. In this case it is a direct correlation of claims where the first\_name attribute of Facebook users is mapped to the givenname attribute used in the Identity Server. |
        | last\_name                  | `                                   http://wso2.org/claims/lastname                                 `     | Here we map the value in Facebook with the claim URI in the Identity Server. In this case it is a direct correlation of claims where the last\_name attribute of Facebook users is mapped to the lastname attribute used in the Identity Server.   |

        !!! note
        
			The **User ID Claim** is important to define as it is the unique
			value used to identify the user. In cases where you have a user
			store connected to the Identity Server, this User ID Claim value
			is used to search for the user in the user store. You can define
			it when configuring the claims for the identity provider or when
			configuring the claims for the service provider. In this use
			case this is configured for the
			[service provider](#LoggingintoSalesforcewithFacebook-subject-claim-id)
			[by configuring the Subject Claim
			URI](#LoggingintoSalesforcewithFacebook-subject-claim-id).
	
			If WSO2 Identity server sends roles instead of users and if you
			want to use those roles to be JIT provisioned to the users of
			the local userstore, you need to configure **Role Claim URI**.
			This configuration is not required for this tutorial.
        

        You can retrieve all the public information of the user and the
        email address. The following are some common attribute names.

        -	id  
        -	email  
        -	name  
        -	first\_name  
        -	last\_name  
        -	link  
        -	gender  
        -	locale  
        -	age\_range

        More information is available from the following link:
        <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.0>
        . You can map these attributes to any **Local Claim URI** that
        is suitable.  
        For more information about claim mapping, see [Claim
        Management](../../learn/claim-management).

6.  Go to **Facebook Configuration** under **Federated Authenticators**.

7.  Select both check-boxes to **Enable Facebook Authenticator** and
    make it the **Default**.

8.  Enter the **App ID** and **App Secret** values from the Facebook app
    you created in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields
    respectively.

    !!! info 
		Navigate to the [Facebook developer
		console](https://developers.facebook.com/) and click on your app
		that is under the **My App** drop down.

    under **Federated Authentication**.

6.  Ensure that the **Federated Authentication** radio button is
    selected and select **Facebook** from the dropdown. This is the name
    of the identity provider that you configured.

    ![fb-federated-authentication](../../assets/img/tutorials/fb-federated-authentication.png)

7.  Click **Update** to save the changes.

You have now added the identity provider as the federated authenticator
for Salesforce.

### Testing the configurations

Do the following steps to test out the configurations for a new user in
Salesforce and the Identity Server.

1.  Create a user in Salesforce. This user should have the same email
    address as your Facebook account.
    1.  Log in to the Salesforce developer account:
        [https://login.salesforce.com/](https://login.salesforce.com/?lt=de).
    2.  On the left navigation pane, click **Users** under **Manage
        Users**.
    3.  On the page that appears, click the **New User** button to
        create a new user.
    4.  Create a user with the same email address as the user on
        Facebook.

        !!! note
        
			-   Define the User License as Salesforce for this tutorial. For
				more information on the Salesforce user license, see the
				[Salesforce developer
				documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=users_license_types_available.htm&type=5)
				.

				on the Salesforce user profiles, see the [Salesforce
				developer
				documentation.](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=standard_profiles.htm&type=0)
        

    5.  Click **Save** to save your changes. An email will be sent to
        the email address you provided for the user.

2.  Logout of Salesforce.
3.  Access your Salesforce login URL on an incognito or private browser.

    !!! info 
		The salesforce login URL is unique to your Salesforce application.
		Follow the steps given below to get this URL:

		1.  Search for My Domain in the search bar that is on the left
			navigation panel.
			
		2.  Click My Domain and you are navigated to the domain you created
			under the section [Configuring
			Salesforce](#ConfiguringSalesforce)
			.

		3.  Click **Edit** under Authentication Configurations and you are
			navigated to a new page having the following URl:
			`             https://<DOMAIN_NAME>/domainname/EditLogin.apexp            `
			
		4.  On the left navigation menu, expand **Security Controls** , and
			click, **Single Sign-On Settings**.
			
		5.  Click on the name of the Single Sign-On Setting you created. In
			this use case click **SSO**.  
			![sso-name](../../assets/img/tutorials/sso-name.png)
			
		6.  Copy the URL that is defined for Login URL to access
			Salesforce.  
			![login-url-for-salesforce](../../assets/img/tutorials/login-url-for-salesforce.png)

    You are directed to the **Facebook Login** screen.  
    ![fb-login-screen](../../assets/img/tutorials/fb-login-screen.png)

4.  Log in using your Facebook credentials. You are then redirected back
    to Salesforce.  
    Remember to use the same email address as the user in the Salesforce
    account.

Now you have successfully configured WSO2 Identity server so you can
login to Salesforce using Facebook as the Identity Provider.
