# SAML 2.0 Web SSO

SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, which is an XML
based data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data
between an identity provider and a service provider. The single most
important requirement that SAML addresses is web browser single sign-on
(SSO). Three main roles are defined in SAML Specification.

1.  The Principal: This is typically the user who tries to access a
    protected resource or service of a service provider.
2.  The Identity Provider: An Identity Provider (IdP) is responsible for
    authenticating users and issuing assertions which include
    authentication/authorization decisions and user attributes.
3.  The Service Provider: A Service Provider(SP) consumes the assertions
    issued by Identity Provider and provides services to the principals.

The main use case scenario covered by SAML is the Principal (the user)
requesting access to resource or service from the Service Provider. Then
the Service Provider, using SAML, communicates with the Identity
Provider to obtain identity assertion. The Service Provider makes the
access control decision, depending on this assertion.

SAML 2.0 is the latest version of SAML, which uses security tokens
containing assertions to pass information about a user between an
identity provider and a service provider.

SAML 2.0 provides five main specifications:

-   [Core](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf)
-   [Bindings](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf)
-   [Profiles](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf)
-   [Metadata](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf)
-   [Conformances](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-conformance-2.0-os.pdf)

This
[article](https://wso2.com/library/articles/2014/02/introduction-to-security-assertion-markup-language-2.0/)
provides more information about above specifications.

#### SAML 2.0 web browser-based SSO profile

SAML 2.0 Web Browser based SSO profile is defined under the SAML 2.0
Profiles specification.

In a web browser based SSO system, the flow can be started by the user
either by attempting to access a service at the service provider or by
directly accessing the identity provider itself.

**If the user accesses a service at a service provider:**

1.  The service provider determines which identity provider to use (this
    is the case when there are multiple identity providers. SAML
    identity provider [discovery
    profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-idp-discovery.pdf)
    may be used).
2.  The service provider generates a SAML message and then redirects the
    web browser to the identity provider along with the message.
3.  Identity provider authenticates the user.
4.  The identity provider generates a SAML message and then redirects
    the web browser back to the service provider.
5.  The service provider processes the SAML message and decides to grant
    or deny access to the user.

If the user accesses the identity provider directly, then only the steps
3, 4 and 5 are in the flow.

The message MUST contain an element which uniquely identifies the
service provider who created the message. Optionally the message may
contain elements such as Issuer, NameIDPolicy, etc. More information
regarding the message can be found in [SAML Core
Specification](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/35711/sstc-saml-core-errata-2.0-wd-06-diff.pdf)
.

The following diagram illustrates the scenario:

![saml2-web-sso-intro](../../assets/img/tutorials/saml2-web-sso-intro.png)

#### SAML 2.0 SSO assertion consumers

Service providers act as SAML assertion consumers. They have two basic
functions:

1.  Create messages and redirect users to the identity provider with the
    created message.
2.  Process messages from the identity provider and make decisions based
    on them.

The following code is a sketch of a sample service provider servlet in a
SAML 2.0 Web-Browser based SSO system.

``` java
	public class Resource extends HttpServlet 
	{             
		 private static SamlConsumer consumer = new SamlConsumer();           
		 public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
		 { 
				 requestMessage = consumer.buildRequestMessage();
				 response.sendRedirect(requestMessage);
		 }            
		 public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
		 { 
				 responseMessage = request.getParameter("SAMLResponse").toString();  
				 result = consumer.processResponseMessage(responseMessage);
		 }
	}
```

When a web user attempts to access the above servlet, its **doGet()**
method is called. Inside the **doGet()** method, it generates an message
and then redirects the user to the Identity Provider.

After authentication is completed by the Identity Provider, it does a
POST call back to the above servlet with a message. Then the
**doPost()** method of the servlet gets called and inside the
**doPost()** method, it retrieves the message from the request and then
the message is passed to the **SamlConsumer** instance for processing.

#### <AuthnRequest\> Message

To create an `         <AuthnRequest>        ` message using the
OpenSAML library:

1.  Add the OpenSAML library to the build path of the project. You can
    download the open SAML JAR file from
    [here](http://code.google.com/p/saml2-consumer-module/downloads/detail?name=opensaml2-2.0.0.alpha1-wso2v1.jar)
    .
2.  A sample **\<AuthnRequest\>** message can be found
    [here](http://wso2.org/files/AuthRequest.xml).
3.  According to SAML 2.0 specifications, the message must contain an
    element. Create the **Issuer** element first.

    ``` java
        String issuerId = "saml2.sso.demo";
        IssuerBuilder issuerBuilder = new IssuerBuilder();
        Issuer issuer = issuerBuilder.buildObject("urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion", "Issuer", "samlp");
        issuer.setValue(issuerId);
    ```

4.  Create the `           <AuthnRequest>          ` next.

    ``` java
        // the issuerUrl is the url of the service provider who generates the  message
        String issuerUrl = "http://localhost:8080/saml2.sso.demo/consumer";
        DateTime issueInstant = new DateTime();
        AuthnRequestBuilder authnRequestBuilder = new AuthnRequestBuilder();
        AuthnRequest authnRequest = authnRequestBuilder.buildObject("urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol", "AuthnRequest", "samlp");
        authnRequest.setForceAuthn(false);
        authnRequest.setIsPassive(false);
        authnRequest.setIssueInstant(issueInstant);
        authnRequest.setProtocolBinding("urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST");
        authnRequest.setAssertionConsumerServiceURL(issuerUrl);
        authnRequest.setIssuer(issuer);
        authnRequest.setID(aRandomId);
        authnRequest.setVersion(SAMLVersion.VERSION_20); 
    ```

    The message may contain many other elements like, etc. those
    elements can be created and added to the message in the same way.

5.  Next encode the message.

    ``` java
        Marshaller marshaller = Configuration.getMarshallerFactory().getMarshaller(authnRequest);
        Element authDOM = marshaller.marshall(authnRequest);
    
        StringWriter rspWrt = new StringWriter();
        XMLHelper.writeNode(authDOM, rspWrt);
        String requestMessage = rspWrt.toString();
                 
        Deflater deflater = new Deflater(Deflater.DEFLATED, true);
        ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        DeflaterOutputStream deflaterOutputStream = new DeflaterOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream, deflater);
        deflaterOutputStream.write(requestMessage.getBytes());
        deflaterOutputStream.close();
                 
        /* Encoding the compressed message */
        String encodedRequestMessage = Base64.encodeBytes(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray(), Base64.DONT_BREAK_LINES);
        String encodedAuthnRequest = URLEncoder.encode(encodedRequestMessage,"UTF-8").trim();
    ```

6.  Construct the redirection URL.

    redirectionUrl = identitypProviderUrl+ "?SAMLRequest=" +
    encodedRequestMessage;

7.  Redirect the user to the identity provider.

    response.sendRedirect(redirectionUrl);

#### <Response\> Message

To read the `         <Response>        ` message issued by the WSO2
Identity Server:

1.  A sample \<Response\> message can be found
    [here](http://wso2.org/files/Response.xml).

2.  The response message must be fetched from the request.

    ``` xml
        responseMessage = request.getParameter("SAMLResponse").toString();
    ```

3.  The fetched “ **responseMessage** ” is unmarshaled and the SAML
    message is retrieved.

    ``` java
        DocumentBuilderFactory documentBuilderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
        documentBuilderFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
        DocumentBuilder docBuilder = documentBuilderFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
         
        byte[] base64DecodedResponse = Base64.decode(responseMessage);
        ByteArrayInputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(base64DecodedResponse);
        Document document = docBuilder.parse(is);
        Element element = document.getDocumentElement();
        UnmarshallerFactory unmarshallerFactory = Configuration.getUnmarshallerFactory();
        Unmarshaller unmarshaller = unmarshallerFactory.getUnmarshaller(element);
        Response response = (Response) unmarshaller.unmarshall(element);
    ```

4.  The retrieved SAML 2.0 Response message can be easily processed. For
    example, lets takes the User Name or the Subject's Name Id.

    ``` xml 
        String subject = response.getAssertions().get(0).getSubject()
        .getNameID().getValue();
    ```

5.  Alternatively, if the response is signed by the IdP, you can
    retrieve the certificate.

    ``` xml
        String certificate =
        response.getSignature().getKeyInfo().getX509Datas().get(0).getX509Certificates().get(0).getValue();
    ```

Likewise the message from the WSO2 Identity Server can be read easily.

#### Relay state

The RelayState parameter is used so that the service provider can pass
some value to the identity provider with the
`         AuthnRequest        ` and get the same value back with the
`         Response        ` . This value can be any string and can be
useful for service provider application logic (when there is a failure,
redirecting to the URL that comes as the RelayState parameter is one way
that this can be used).

-   For a inbound request to the Identity Server, if the
    `          RelayState         ` parameter is present, the Identity
    Server sends back the same value in the response.
-   For federation using SAML2, the Identity Server uses the
    `          RelayState         ` parameter to pass the session index,
    which is required to continue the authentication flow after
    receiving authentication response.

#### Identity provider initiated SSO

To initiate IdP Initiated SSO you need to perform a HTTP GET/POST to the
following URL (assume the registered service provider issuer ID is
foo.com)

<https://localhost:9443/samlsso?spEntityID=foo.com>

!!! note
    To make this work, IdP initiated SSO should be enabled in your IdP.
    

This request will authenticate and redirect the user to the registered
Assertion Consumer URL. Optionally, you can send in a RelayState
parameter as follows.

<https://localhost:9443/samlsso?spEntityID=foo.com&RelayState=http://localhost:8080/foo.com/my-home.jsp>

This request will authenticate and redirect the user to the URL in the
RelayState parameter itself.

!!! info 
	Either you could have SP Initiated SSO only, or SP Initiated SSO and IdP
	Initiated SSO. You can't have IdP initiated SSO only. By design, SP
	Initiated SSO is more restrictive and secure. If a service provider is
	allowed to do IdP Initiated SSO, it would automatically imply that this
	service provider is allowed to do SP initiated SSO as well.
