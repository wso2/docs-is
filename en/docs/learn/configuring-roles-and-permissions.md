# Configuring Roles and Permissions

Roles contain permissions for users to manage the server. You can create
different roles with various combinations of permissions and assign them
to a user or a group of users. Through the Management Console, you can
also edit and delete an existing user role.

WSO2 supports the role-based authentication model where privileges of a
user are based on the role it is attached with. By default, WSO2
products come with the following roles:

-   **Admin** - Provides full access to all features and controls. By
    default, the user "admin" is assigned to both the "Admin" and the
    "Everyone" roles. The Identity Server does not allow you to
    configure permissions assigned to the 'Admin' role.
-   **Everyone** - Every new user is assigned to this role by default.
    It does not include any permissions.
-   **System** - This role is not visible in the Management Console.

If a user has several assigned roles, their permissions are added
together.

WSO2 products has two types of roles. **External Roles** and **Internal
Roles**. Let say there are two user stores.

  

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><br />
</th>
<th><strong>Store-A</strong></th>
<th><strong>Store-B</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Users</td>
<td>user_A</td>
<td>user_B</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Roles</td>
<td>role_A</td>
<td>role_B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  

**External Roles :**  
Store in user store itself. Only users in that user store can assign to
external roles in same user store.  
Example : user\_A can assign to role\_A  
user\_B can't assign to role\_A

In the user stores Users are assign to a Groups. Within the WSO2 servers
we have Roles and directly map one Group to a Role then assign the
permission for that role. There is a one to one mapping between Groups
and Roles and same Group name is used to represent the Role in the
server.  
  

**Internal Roles :**

Store in Identity server database. User in all user stores can assign to
these roles.

Example : both user\_A and user\_B can assign to same internal role

For internal Roles there are no mapped Groups in user stores. So we
directly assign users to these roles (Do not support to assign Groups to
these Roles)

!!! info 
        **Internal/everyone :** This is a conceptual role that is used to group
        all the users (across the user stores) together. When you create a new
        user, automatically the user belongs to the Internal/everyone role.

        **Application Role** : is a special case of internal roles, these are
        created for a single service provider ( SP ) application and only users
        in this role canmange relevant SP application.

### Adding a user role

#### Add role using management console

Follow the instructions below to add a user role.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the [Management
    Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console)
   , click **Add** under **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Roles**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role.  
3.  Click **Add New Role**.
4.  Do the following:  
    1.  In the **Domain** list, specify the user store where you want to
        create this role.
    2.  Enter a unique name for this role.
    3.  Click **Next**.  
        ![unique-rolename](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/unique-rolename.png)
5.  Select the permissions you want users with this role to have. You
    can also not assign permissions to a role. Note that when you assign
    this role to a user, you can override the role's permissions and
    customize them for the user.  
    ![role-permissions](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/role-permissions.png) 
6.  Select the existing users you want to have this role. You can also
    assign this role to users later, but if you are creating this role
    in an external user store that does not allow empty roles, you must
    assign it to at least one user. You can search for a user by name(or
    user role by role name), or view all users or roles by entering
    `          *         ` in the search field.
7.  Click **Finish**.

The role is created and is listed on the Roles page. You can now edit
the role as needed.

#### Add role using SCIM

-   In SCIM creating role means creating a **group.** Read more on
    [SCIM](../../develop/scim-1.1-apis).

    !!! note
    
        When creating a group with users, you need to have that
        user already exists in the user store and provide its unique id.
        Create a new group named: 'engineer' with the user 'hasinitg' as a
        member. The attributes you have to include in the cURL command are
        the userID, username:password.

    **Request**

    ``` java
    curl -v -k --user {IS_USERNAME}:{IS_PASSWORD} --data '{"displayName": {GROUP_NAME},"members": {MEMBERS_OF_THE_GROUP}}' --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://{IS_IP}:{IS_PORT}/wso2/scim/Groups
    ```

    **Request: Sample**

    ``` java
        curl -v -k --user admin:admin --data '{"displayName": "engineer","members": [{"value":"316214c0-dd7e-4dc3-bed8-e91227d32597","hasinitg": "hasinitg"}]}' --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim/Groups
    ```

    You receive a response with the payload as indicated below and a
    response status `           201 CREATED          ` :

    **Response**

    ``` java
        {"id":"b4f9bccf-4f79-4288-be21-78e0d4500714","schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],"displayName":"PRIMARY/engineer","members":[{"value":"0032fd29-55a9-4fb9-be82-b1c97c073f02","display":"hasinitg"}],"meta":{"lastModified":"2016-01-26T18:31:57","created":"2016-01-26T18:31:57","location":"https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim/Groups/b4f9bccf-4f79-4288-be21-78e0d4500714"}}
    ```

    You can observe in the management console of IS, that the new group
    is listed under roles and user 'hasinitg' is listed under users of
    that group.

#### Add role using SOAP

A role can be created by calling the service
`         RemoteUserStoreManager        ` . If you are new to admin
services, see [Calling Admin
Services.](../../develop/calling-admin-services)

1.  Disable the hidden admin service property in the file
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml          ` .  
    By default, the admin services are disabled as it is not recommended
    to expose these URLs to users. However, this can be enabled by the
    administrators if it needs to be accessed.

    ``` java
        <HideAdminServiceWSDLs>false</HideAdminServiceWSDLs>
    ```

2.  Open the following Admin Service from SOAP UI:
    [https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl  
    ](https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl)

    !!! info 
        If you have configured WSO2 IS to use an IP or hostname, replace
        `            localhost           ` with your IP or hostname.

3.  Call the method **`            addRole()           `** to create a
    role.

    **SOAP Request**

    ``` xml
        <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ser="http://service.ws.um.carbon.wso2.org" xmlns:xsd="http://dao.service.ws.um.carbon.wso2.org/xsd">
           <soapenv:Header/>
           <soapenv:Body>
              <ser:addRole>
                 <!--Optional:-->
                 <ser:roleName>engineer</ser:roleName>
                 <!--Zero or more repetitions:-->
                 <ser:userList>hasinitg</ser:userList>
                 <!--Zero or more repetitions:-->
              </ser:addRole>
           </soapenv:Body>
        </soapenv:Envelope>
    ```

    The role is created and is listed on the Roles page. You can now
    edit the role as needed.

### Updating role names

To make modifications to the role names, do one of the following:

#### Update before the first startup (recommended)

You can change the default role names ( `         admin        ` and
`         everyone        ` ) before starting up the WSO2 Identity
Server. To do this, change the properties in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml       ` file as shown below.

-   Change `          <AdminRole>admin</AdminRole>         ` to
            `   <AdminRole>                     New role name          </AdminRole\> `.
    ```xml
        [super_admin]
        admin_role = "New role name" 
    ```
-   Change
    `          <EveryOneRoleName>everyone</EveryOneRoleName>         `
    to       `<EveryOneRoleName>                     New role name      </EveryOneRoleName> `.

```xml
    [super_admin]
    username = "admin"
    password = "admin"
    create_admin_account = true
    admin_role = "admin"
    [realm_manager]
    data_source = "jdbc/WSO2CarbonDB"
```
#### Update after the product is used for sometime (advanced configuration)

If you have already updated the role names before the first startup of
the product, these steps are not necessary. The following steps guide
you through updating the role names after you have used the product for
some time.

1.  Make the configuration changes indicated in the above
    section.
2.  Do the following user store level changes for existing users:  
    -   If you are connected to the
        `             JDBCUserStoreManager            `, update the
        `             UM_USER_ROLE            ` table with the existing
        users and the new role names that you defined in place of the
        'admin' and 'everyone' roles. If you have changed the
        permissions of the 'everyone' role, update the
        `             UM_ROLE_PERMISSION            ` table the
        permissions of the new role.

        !!! info 
            The schema can be located by referring to the data source
            defined in the deployment.toml file. The data source definition
            can also be found in the same file. 

    -   If you are connected to the
        `            ReadWriteLdapUserStoreManager,           `
        populate the members of the previous admin role to the new
        role under **Groups**.

3.  After the changes have been made, restart the server.

-   [Update before the first startup
    (recommended)](#update-before-the-first-startup-(recommended))
-   [Update after the product is used for sometime (advanced
    configuration)](#update-after-the-product-is-used-for-sometime-(advancedconfiguration))

### Searching for roles

Once you have added a role in the Identity Server, you can search for
the role by doing the following.

1.  On the **Main** tab in the Management Console, click **List** under
    **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Roles**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role. The following screen appears.  
    ![admin-role](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/admin-role.png)  
    You can search for users by doing the following.
    1.  Select the user store that the role resides in using the
        **Select Domain** dropdown.
    2.  Enter the role name of the role and click **Search Roles**. For
        roles to be listed, you must use the exact name of the role, or
        use a role name pattern by including \* . For example, if you
        have a role named Manager, you can either search for this role
        by searching for "Manager", or you could search for "Ma\*" to
        list out all the role with names beginning with "Ma".
    3.  The role is displayed in the list.

### Editing or deleting a role

#### Using management console

If you need to make modifications to a role, use the links in the
**Actions** column on the **Roles** screen as follows:

![actions-on-roles](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/actions-on-roles.png)

-   Rename the role
-   Change the default permissions associated with this role
-   Assign this role to users
-   View the users who are assigned this role
-   Delete the role if you no longer need it  

!!! info 
    If the role is in an external user store to which you are connected in
    read-only mode, you will be able to view the existing roles but not edit
    or delete them. However, you can still create new editable roles.

#### Using SCIM

In SCIM roles are considered as **groups.** You can edit or delete a
group using SCIM. Please read more about
[SCIM](../../develop/scim-1.1-apis) for further
details.

#### Using SOAP

A role can be edited or deleted by calling the service
`         RemoteUserStoreManager        ` . If you are new to admin
services, see [Calling Admin
Services.](../../develop/calling-admin-services)

1.  Disable the hidden admin service property in the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml          ` file.  
    By default, the admin services are disabled as it is not recommended
    to expose these URLs to users. However, this can be enabled by the
    administrators if it needs to be accessed.

    ``` java
    [admin_service.wsdl]
    enable = false
    ```

2.  Open the following Admin Service from SOAP UI:
    [https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl  
    ](https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl)

    !!! info 
        If you have configured WSO2 IS to use an IP or hostname, replace
        `            localhost           ` with your IP or hostname.

3.  Call the method **updateRoleName `            ()           `** to
    rename a role and **deleteRole()** to delete a role.

    **SOAP Request " Update Role name**
