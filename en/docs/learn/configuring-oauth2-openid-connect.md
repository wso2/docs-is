# Configuring OAuth2-OpenID Connect

[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an authorization framework that is
capable of providing a way for clients to access a resource with
restricted access on behalf of the resource owner. OAuth 2.0 is capable
of authorizing the flows for web applications, desktop applications, and
mobile applications among others.

OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0,
which facilitates clients to verify the end-user identity against the
authentication performed by an authorization server. At the same time,
it provides methods to transfer the end user information through claims.

With OAuth as its base, OpenID Connect allows many types of clients such
as web-based clients, mobile clients and javascript clients to verify
the users with an authorization server-based authentication.

1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the
    [Management
    Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console).
    
2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu. Click
    **Add** under **Identity Providers**.  
    For more information, see [Adding and Configuring an Identity
    Provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider).
    
3.  Fill in the details in the **Basic Information** section.

4.  Expand the **Federated Authenticators** section and then the
    **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Configuration** form.  
    ![oauth2-openid-connect-configuration](../../assets/img/tutorials/oauth2-openid-connect-configuration.png)
    
5.  Fill in the following fields where relevant.

    Prior to this, you need to configure an application for Identity
    server in the federated authorization server and get the application
    information such as client ID and secret. For more information, see
    [configuring OAuth2-OpenID Connect single
    sign-on](../../learn/configuring-oauth2-openid-connect-single-sign-on).

    !!! tip
        By default, the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** are stored as
        plain text values, where the **Client Secret** is generally stored
        as a random number generated using two UUIDs and HMAC-SHA1 hash
        function, which is known to resist the strongest attack known
        against HMAC.
    
        If you want to change the format in which the **Client Secret** is
        stored, open the `	<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml	` file and add the following configuration.
        ```xml
        [oauth]
		hash_tokens_and_secrets: 
		```
        For information on
        possible values that you can specify based on your
        requirement, see [Supported token persistence
        processors](../../learn/extension-points-for-oauth#supported-token-persistence-processor).
    
        Once you configure a required token persistence processor, be sure
        to restart the server for the changes to be applied to WSO2 Identity
        Server.

    | Enable OAuth2/OpenIDConnect     | Selecting this option enables OAuth2/OpenID Connect to be used as an authenticator for users provisioned to the Identity Server.                                                                                                     | Selected                                   |
    | Default                         | Selecting the **Default** check box signifies that the OAuth2/OpenID Connect credentials are the main/default form of authentication.
