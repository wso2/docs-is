# Basic Client Profile with Playground

This section demonstrates the WSO2 Identity Server's OpenID Connect
Basic Client Profile implementation with the WSO2 OAuth2 playground
sample.

### Setting up the playground sample

First follow the instructions in the sections below to set up the
playground sample and register it in WSO2 IS. Once you have done so,
complete the user profile by adding user attributes and try out the
scenario.

??? note "Set up the WSO2 OAuth2.0 Playground sample"

    **Configuring OAuth for WSO2 Playground**

    Before you begin, you must first configure OAuth for a service provider
    to use this sample.

    1.  Add a new service provider.
        1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the
            [Management
            Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console)
            .
        2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu.
            Click **Add** under **Service Providers**.
        3.  Fill in the **Service Provider Name** and provide a brief
            **Description** of the service provider. Only **Service Provider
            Name** is a required field.
        4.  Click **Register** to add the new service provider.
    2.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and
        [configure OAuth/OpenID
        Connect.](../../tutorials/configuring-oauth2-openid-connect-single-sign-on)

        !!! note 
            You can use the following **Callback URL** when configuring
            OAuth for WSO2 Playground:
            `                               http://wso2is.local:8080/playground2/oauth2client                             `

    To obtain and configure the Playground sample, follow the steps below.

    1.  You can check out the repository of the OAuth 2.0 sample from
        GitHub. Follow the instructions
        [here](../../using-wso2-identity-server/downloading-a-sample) to
        checkout the folder. We refer
        `              <SAMPLE_HOME>             ` as the modules/samples
        folder inside the folder where the product-is repository is checked
        out.

    2.  Open a terminal window and add the following entry to the
        `              /etc/hosts             ` file of your machine to
        configure the hostname.

        !!! info "Why is this step needed?"
            Some browsers do not allow you to create cookies for a naked
            hostname, such as `               localhost              ` . Cookies
            are required when working with SSO . Therefore, to ensure that the
            SSO capabilities work as expected in this tutorial, you need to
            configure the `               etc/host              ` file as
            explained in this step.

            The `               etc/host              ` file is a read-only
            file. Therefore, you won't be able to edit it by opening the file
            via a text editor. To avoid this, edit the file using the terminal
            commands.  
            For example, use the following command if you are working on a
            Mac/Linux environment.

            ``` java
            sudo nano /etc/hosts
            ```

        ``` bash
            127.0.0.1        wso2is.local
        ```

    3.  Navigate to
        `              <SAMPLE_HOME>/oauth2/playground2             `
        directory via the terminal and build the sample using the following
        command. You must have Apache Maven installed to do this (see
        [Installation
        Prerequisites](../../setup/installation-prerequisites)
        for the appropriate version to use).

        ``` java
            mvn clean install
        ```

    4.  After successfully building the sample, a .
        `              war             ` file named **playground2** can be
        found inside the
        `              <SAMPLE_HOME>/oauth2/playground2/target             `
        folder. Deploy this sample web app on a web container, such as
        Apache Tomcat server.

        !!! note
            Since this sample is written based on Servlet 3.0 it needs to be
            deployed on Tomcat 7.x.

        Use the following steps to deploy the web app in the web container:

        1.  Stop the Apache Tomcat server if it is already running.
        2.  Copy the `               playground2.war              ` file to
            the `               <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps              ` folder.
        3.  Start the Apache Tomcat server.

    5.  Make sure to update `              param-value             `
        parameter in the `              WEB-INF/web.xml             ` file
        with the server URL of the Identity Server if required.  
        Make sure to enter the port the application is running on, in the
        URL. If you have started the Identity Server with a port off set,
        then the respective port needs to be configured here.

        ``` java
        <init-param>
            <description>serverUrl</description>
            <param-name>serverUrl</param-name>
            <param-value>https://localhost:9443/services/</param-value>
        </init-param>
        ```

        !!! info 
            Note that localhost is the server that hosts WSO2 Identity Server
            and 9443 is the default SSL port of it. In order to access the admin
            services you should have the values in step 5 and 6. Since
            playground application is accessing the admin service
            OAuth2TokenValidationService, you should have the correct
            serverUrl,username and password as described in step 5 and 6.

    6.  Update **`               param-value              `** parameter with
        credentials of an admin user if required.

        ``` java
            <init-param>
                <description>userName</description>
                <param-name>userName</param-name>
                <param-value>admin</param-value>
            </init-param>
            <init-param>
                <description>password</description>
                <param-name>password</param-name>
                <param-value>admin</param-value>
            </init-param>
        ```

    7.  Restart Apache Tomcat and access
        `              http://wso2is.local:8080/playground2/             `  
        By default Tomcat runs on port 8080. If you have configured it to
        run on a different port make sure to update the URL and access the
        playground application.  
        You are directed to the landing page of the sample application.
        Click on **Import Photos** and the following page appears.  
        ![click-on-import-photos](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/click-on-import-photos.png) 

    !!! note "Are you getting the error that is given below?"        
        
        ``` java
            javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
        ```
        
        The sample applications do not have a keystore in them. Therefore, after
        changing the tomcat hostname you might get this error because the public
        key of the WSO2 Identity Server does not exist in the Java certificate
        store. 
        

    This application is used to request access tokens using the four OAuth2
    grant types:

    -   [Authorization Code
        Grant](../../using-wso2-identity-server/try-authorization-code-grant)
    -   [Client Credentials
        Grant](../../using-wso2-identity-server/try-client-credentials-grant)
    -   [Implicit
        Grant](../../using-wso2-identity-server/try-implicit-grant)
    -   [Try Password/Resource Owner
        Grant](../../using-wso2-identity-server/try-password-grant)


??? note "Register the Playground application in WSO2 Identity Server"
    In order to configure Single-Sign-On (SSO) for OAuth2-OpenID Connect,
    you must first [register a service provider for inbound
    authentication](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-inbound-authentication-for-a-service-provider).

    [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) has three main phases. They are;
    requesting an Authorization Grant, exchanging the Authorization Grant
    for an Access Token and accessing the resources using this Access Token.
    [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) is another identity layer
    on top of OAuth 2.0. OAuth applications can get authentication event
    information over the IDToken and can get the extra claims of the
    authenticated user from the OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint.  

    To enable OAuth support for your client application, you must first
    register your application. Follow the instructions below to add a new
    application.  

    Let's get started to configure the service provider you created!

    1.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and then
        expand **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration.** Click **Configure**.
    2.  Fill in the form that appears. For the **Allowed Grant Types** you
        can disable the ones you do not require or wish to block.

        !!! note
            The grant type highlighted below is a **custom** grant type. This
            will only appear on the UI if you have [configured the JWT grant
            type](../../develop/configuring-jwt-grant-type)
            . The value specified in the
            `              <GrantTypeName>             ` property of the
            `              identity.xml             ` file when creating the
            custom grant type is the value that will appear on the UI. For more
            information on writing a custom grant type, see [Writing a Custom
            OAuth 2.0 Grant
            Type](../../using-wso2-identity-server/writing-a-custom-oauth-2.0-grant-type).
        
        ![select-allowed-grant-types](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/select-allowed-grant-types.png) 

        When filling out the **New Application** form, the following details should be taken into consideration.                   
    <table>

                The following grant types are used to generate the access token:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Code</strong> : Entering the username and password required at the service provider will result in a code being generated. This code can be used to obtain the access token. For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">Authorization Code specification</a> .</li>
                <li><strong>Implicit</strong> : This is similar to the code grant type, but instead of generating a code, this directly provides the access token. For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2">Implicit Grant specification</a> .</li>
                <li><strong>Password</strong> : This authenticates the user using the password provided and the access token is provided. For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3">Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant specification</a> .</li>
                <li><strong>Client Credential</strong> : This is the grant type for the client key and client secret. If these two items are provided correctly by the service provider, the access token is sent. For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4">Client Credentials specification.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Refresh Token</strong> : This will enable the user to obtain an access token by using the refresh token once the originally provided access token is used up. For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5">Refresh Token specification</a> .</li>
                <li><strong>SAML2</strong> : This uses SAML assertion to obtain the access token . For more information on this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-23.txt">SAML2 Bearer specification</a> .</li>
                <li><strong>IWA-NTLM</strong> : This is similar to the password grant type, but it is specific to Microsoft Windows users.</li>
                <li><strong>urn:ietf:params:oauth: grant-type:jwt-bearer</strong> : This is a custom grant type. It uses a JWT token to obtain the access token. For more information about this grant type, see this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523">JWT specification</a> .</li>

                    <p>From IS 5.2.0 onwards, regex-based consumer URLs are supported when defining the callback URL. This enables you to configure multiple callback URLs for one application by entering a regex pattern as the value for the callback URL field.<br />
                        For example, if you have two service providers that use the same application, you can now define a regex pattern which will work for both callback URLs instead of having to configure two different applications for the two service providers. Assume the two callback URLs for your two service providers are as follows:

                    <ul>

            The OAuth client key and client secret are stored in plain text. To
            encrypt the client secret, access token and refresh token, do the
            following:
        
            Open the `              identity.xml             ` file found in the
            `              <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity             `
            directory and change the
            `              <TokenPersistenceProcessor>             ` property as
            follows:
        
            ``` xml
                <TokenPersistenceProcessor>org.wso2.carbon.identity.oauth.tokenprocessor.EncryptionDecryptionPersistenceProcessor</TokenPersistenceProcessor>
            ```

        After updating the configuration, make sure to restart the server
        for the changes to be applied on WSO2 IS.

### Try out scenario

1.  Visit the URL
    `                       http://wso2is.local:8080/playground2/oauth2.jsp                     `
    to start the scenario with the sample application.
2.  Enter the following details and click **Authorize**.

    -   **Authorization Grant Type:** Authorization Code
    -   **Client ID:** (the client id received at the application
        registration step in Identity Server)
    -   **Scope:** openid (This scope is a requirement to provide user
        information. Any token without this scope will not be allowed to
        access user information.)
    -   **Callback URL:**
        http://wso2is.local:8080/playground2/oauth2client
    -   **Authorize Endpoint:** https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize

    !!! note
    
        To try out this scenario with different consent values,
        see step 7.
    

    ![different-consent-values](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/different-consent-values.png) 

      

3.  Provide user credentials and sign in with the previously created
    user.  
    ![sign-in-with-pkce](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/sign-in-with-pkce.png)   
    
4.  Click **Approve** to provide consent to this action. The screen
    mentions the service provider by name and requests for user consent
    to provide user information to that particular service provider. The
    user can either

    1.  **Deny** to provide information to the service provider.
    2.  **Approve** to provide user profile information to this service
        provider only for this time.
    3.  **Approve Always** to provide approval to share user profile
        information with the service provider even in the future without
        prompting for consent again.

    ![approve-consent](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/approve-consent.png) 

    !!! tip
        After approval is provided, the application receives an
        authorization code issued from WSO2 Identity Server. This
        authorization code can only be used once to get a valid access token
        and has a expiry time that can be configured by adding the
        following property in the
        `            <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml           `
        file. The default expiry time is 300 seconds.
    
        ``` xml
        [oauth.token_validation]
        authorization_code_validity= "300"
        ```


5.  Enter the following details in the form that appears and click **Get
    Access Token**.

    -   **Callback URL:**
        http://wso2is.local:8080/playground2/oauth2client
    -   **Access Token Endpoint:** https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
    -   **Client Secret:** (client secret received at the application
        registration)

    ![access-token-details](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/access-token-details.png) 

6.  At this point, the application receives the **Access Token** with
    the id token, which follows the format shown in step 7. Enter the
    UserInfo endpoint of the WSO2 Identity Server, (i.e.,
    `                         https://localhost:9443/oauth2/userinfo?schema=openid                       `
    ), in the form as seen below, to get user information.

    ![logged-in-user-info](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/logged-in-user-info.png) 

    Since the received access token has the scope
    `            openid           `, the
    `            userinfo           ` endpoint provides the user
    attribute details when the request is made. You receive the
    following response from the Identity Server.

    **Response**

    ``` groovy
    {  
       "scope":"openid",
       "token_type":"Bearer",
       "expires_in":3600,
       "refresh_token":"74d0d7e6d4b3c19484f5135593c2dc88",            "id_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdXRoX3RpbWUiOjE0NTIxNzAxNzYsImV4cCI6MTQ1MjE3Mzc3Niwic3ViIjoidXNlQGNhcmJvbi5zdXBlciIsImF6cCI6IjF5TDFfZnpuekdZdXRYNWdCMDNMNnRYR3lqZ2EiLCJhdF9oYXNoIjoiWWljbDFlNTI5WlhZOE9zVDlvM3ktdyIsImF1ZCI6WyIxeUwxX2Z6bnpHWXV0WDVnQjAzTDZ0WEd5amdhIl0sImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOlwvXC9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6OTQ0M1wvb2F1dGgyXC90b2tlbiIsImlhdCI6MTQ1MjE3MDE3Nn0.RqAgm0ybe7tQYvQYi7uqEtzWf6wgDv5sJq2UIQRC4OJGjn_fTqftIWerZc7rIMRYXi7jzuHxX_GabUhuj7m1iRzi1wgxbI9yQn825lDVF4Lt9DMUTBfKLk81KIy6uB_ECtyxumoX3372yRgC7R56_L_hAElflgBsclEUwEH9psE",
       "access_token":"f1824ef345f0565ab88a06a51db98d24"
    }
    ```

    The returned ID token carries the user details. It follows the
    following format:
    `            <header>.<body>.<signature>           ` . The decoded
    ID token can be seen below.

    **Decoded ID Token**

    ``` groovy
        {"alg":"RS256"}.
        {  
           "auth_time":1452170176,
           "exp":1452173776,
           "sub":"use@carbon.super",
           "azp":"1yL1_fznzGYutX5gB03L6tXGyjga",
           "at_hash":"Yicl1e529ZXY8OsT9o3y-w",
           "aud":[  
              "1yL1_fznzGYutX5gB03L6tXGyjga"
           ],
           "iss":"https:\/\/localhost:9443\/oauth2\/token",
           "iat":1452170176
        }.<signature value>
         
    ```

    !!! tip
        Alternatively, you can get user information by running the
        following cURL command on the terminal.
    
        -   **cURL Command**

        ``` powershell
            curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <Acess_token>" https://localhost:9443/oauth2/userinfo?schema=openid
        ```
        
        -   **Response**
        
        ``` groovy
            {  
            "sub":"admin",
            "email":"admin@wso2.com",
            "website":"https://wso2.com",
            "name":"admin",
            "family_name":"admin",
            "preferred_username":"admin",
            "given_name":"admin",
            "profile":"https://wso2.com",
            "country":"Sri Lanka"
            }
        ``` 

7.  You can also try out this scenario with different consent values
    {none, login and consent}. To do this, try the following URLs when
    entering the Authorization Endpoint URL in step 2 of the **Try out
    scenario** section.

    <table>

    </tr>
    <tr class="even">

    </div></div>
    </div></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    !!! note
        To skip user consent, you can also edit the following
        property in the
        `            <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml           `
        file. To skip user
        consent, set this property to false.
    
        ``` xml
        [oauth]
        consent_prompt= true
        ```
        !!! info 
            Note that even if this property is set to true so that it will skip
            user consent, if you use an Authorization Endpoint URL that prompts
            user consent (e.g.,
            `                           https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize?prompt=consent                         `
            ), it will still prompt consent from the user.
