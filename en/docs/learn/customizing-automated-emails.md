# Customizing Automated Emails

The WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) provides the means of customizing
automated emails sent to the user. This is particularly useful in the
case of tenant users as they can customize their emails specifically for
users configured under the tenant. Furthermore, tenants do not have
access to underlying configuration files, therefore, this customization
is now possible directly through the management console.

### Adding an email template type

1.  Log in to the WSO2 Identity Server [management
    console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console)
    .
2.  Navigate to the **Main** tab and click **Add** under **Email
    Templates**, which is available under the **Manage** section **.**
3.  Click **Add Email Template Type.**
4.  Enter the name that you want to be displayed for the new email
    template type in the **Template Type Display Name**.
5.  Click **Add.**

template type and language. As a result, there may be multiple email for
a specific email template type based on the language of the email
template.

    -   **Subject** : This is the subject of the email that is sent to
        the user.
    -   **Email Body** : This is the body of the email that is sent to
        the user. Custom information like

    !!! tip "Placeholders and Custom Claim Dialects"
        You can set different placeholders in order to populate
        custom information such as `            {first-name}           ` and
        `            {user-id}           ` in the subject, body and footer
        of the email template.
    
        You can also specify any custom claim URI created in the WSO2 claim
        dialect:
    
        -   If it an identity claim, specify the claim as seen in the
            example below.
    
            The claim <http://wso2.org/claims/identity/homeAddress> should
            be specified as
            `                {{user.claim.identity.homeAddress}}               `
    
        -   If it is a normal claim, specify the claim as seen in the
            example below.
    
            The claim <http://wso2.org/claims/homeAddress> should be
            specified as
            `                {{user.claim.homeAddress}}               ` .
    
        Before sending the email, the WSO2 IS will retrieve the user details
        from the user store configured for this tenant and replace the
        placeholders with the corresponding values of the user.
    

5.  Click **Add** to add a new email template.

        This is the format used for country locales in the Identity Server.
        For more information on country locales, see
