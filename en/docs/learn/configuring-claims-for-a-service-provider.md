# Configuring Claims for a Service Provider

Claim mapping for a service provider involves mapping claims that are
used by the service provider to the claims local to the WSO2 Identity
Server. For the occasions where a service provider needs some
information of the user from the Identity Server where the service
provider authenticates, the claim mapping is useful. Once the user is
authenticated, the service provider can use these received claim details
to provide its service.  See the [Identity Server
Architecture](../../getting-started/architecture) for more
information on how claim mapping fits in to the overall scheme of
things.

To register a service provider, do the following.

1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the Management Console. 
2.  Navigate to the Main menu to access the Identity menu. Click Add under Service Providers.
3.  Fill in the Service Provider Name and provide a brief Description of the service provider. Only Service Provider Name is a required field.
4.  Click Register to add the new service provider.

### Claim mapping

1.  In the **Claim Configuration** form, select the claim mapping
    dialect by either choosing to use a local claim dialect or define
    your own custom claim dialect.  
    
    1.  If you choose to **Use Local Claim Dialect**, you need to fill
        in the following details.

        1.  Fill in your requested claims by clicking the **Add Claim
            URI** button.
        2.  Choose your **Local Claim** from the drop-down. Select
            whether this claim is a **Mandatory Claim** for the Service
            Provider using the checkbox.  
            ![mandatory-claim](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/mandatory-claim.png)

    2.  If you choose to **Define Custom Claim Dialect**, you need to
        do the following.

        1.  Add a custom claim URI by clicking on the **Add Claim URI**
            button. Clicking this button again enables you to map more
            claims.

        2.  Add the **Service Provider Claim** and choose the
            corresponding **Local Claim** from the drop-down. Select
            whether you want the claim to be a **Requested Claim** and
            whether this claim is a **Mandatory Claim** for the service
            provider, using the relevant checkboxes.

            ??? note "Click to view vital information when configuring claims for an OpenID Connect Service Provider"
                When mapping custom claims for a service provider
                configured with OpenID Connect, ensure to map the custom
                claims in the SP configuration as seen in the screenshot
                above **AND** also add the custom claims to a scope value in
                the **oidc** file.
            
                !!! info "Why?"
            
                    This is required because OpenIDConnect claim scopes are
                    supported from WSO2 IS 5.2.0 onwards. This means that when
                    you request for an OIDC token, you can specify a single
                    scope value that is bound to a set of multiple claims. When
                    that OIDC token is sent to the UserInfo endpoint, only the
                    claims which are common in **both** the OIDC scope config
                    file and the SP claim configuration (i.e., the intersection
                    of claims in both these configurations) will be returned.
            
                To do this,
    
                1.  Click on **List** under **OIDC Scopes** under the **Manage** section of the **Main** tab of the management console.

                2.  Add the custom claims to the existing default scope
                    **openid** by clicking on **Edit.** Alternatively, add a
                    new scope for the custom claims by clicking on **Add New
                    Property** and send it when getting the OIDC token along
                    with the mandatory **openid** scope when getting the OIDC token.
                    ![oidc-scope-list.png](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/oidc-scope-list.png)

                !!! note
                    OIDC considers address as a JSON object. Therefore, if you
                    want to pass an address using a different claim other than
                    the address claim that is already available, you can do it
                    using any of the following methods:
        
                    In here we do not have to add values in complex object
                    format. Just need to put values as street
        
                    -   Without using the `address.` prefix.  
                            For this, you need to register a scope named address in
                            the WSO2 Identity Server's registry and add the value as
                            the street or lane or any preferred value.

                    -   Create a new external claim using the
                            `                  address.                 ` prefix . Let's a look at how to create a new claim for the `address.` prefix.
                        1.  Click **Add** under Claims.
                        2.  Click **Add External Claim**.
                        3.  Select ` http://wso2.ord/oidc/claim ` as the value for **Dialect URI**.
                        4.  Enter `   address.street    ` as the value for **External Claim URI**. 
                            You can enter any value with the prefix ` address. `, such as `  address.country `,
                            ` address.lane  `, and much more.
                        5.  Map the claim you are creating to any claim within WSO2 Identity server.  
                            For example, you can map it to ` http://wso2.org/claims/location `.
            
                    Now you can see the claim you created being listed. It is created as a JSON object in WSO2 Identity Server.
            
            ??? note "Click to view vital information when configuring claims for an SAML2 Service Provider"
                When mapping custom claims for a service provider configured with SAML2, ensure to **select both** " Enable Attribute Profile " and " Include Attributes in the Response Always" from the SAML2 service provider configuration as follows.
            
                ![enable-attribute-profile](../../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/enable-attribute-profile.png)
            
                !!! info "Why?"
            
                        This is required since Identity Server include user claims
                        in the SAML2 response only if SAML2 attribute profile is
                        enabled.
            

            !!! info "Information on mapping claims"
                The **Local Claim** list includes a set of standard claim values which are local to the WSO2 Identity Server. When
                adding a service provider, it is necessary to map the values of the claims local to the service provider with those
                provided in this drop-down list which are local to the Identity Server. This should be done for all values in the
                service provider unless they use the same claim name.

                Marking a claim as a **Mandatory Claim** would ensure that
                the WSO2 IS will definitely send a value for this claim to
                the service provider.  When a user logs into this service
                provider, if the identity provider does not provide a value
                for any of the mandatory claims, the user will be prompted
                to provide them at the time of login as shown in the image
                below.  

                ??? note "Expand for steps to test out mandatory claims"
                    !!! tip "Testing mandatory claims"
                        To test out mandatory claims,
                    
                        1.  Configure the travelocity sample application by
                            following the steps in the [Configuring Single
                            Sign-On](../../tutorials/single-sign-on) topic.
            
                        2.  Configure a few claims and select the checkbox for
                            mandatory claims.
            
                        3.  Ensure that there are one or more claims which are
                            missing in the user profile of the user you wish to
                            login with.
            
                        4.  Run the travelocity sample and try the SAML login.
            
                        5.  Log in with the user credentials of the user who has a
                            few mandatory claims missing, and click **Submit**.
                        6.  A claim request will be prompted, Similiar to the image
                            below. At this point, the mandatory claim rule is
                            enforced and you cannot proceed without providing the
                            necessary claim values. Provide the necessary claim
                            values and click **Submit**.
                        7.  You will be successfully logged in to the application.
        

                Marking a mapped claim as a **Requested Claim** would ensure
                that the service provider definitely sends this claim to the
                Identity Server. This is useful particularly in cases where
                there are hundreds of claims and only specific ones need to
                be sent to the Identity Server.

                **Collecting consent for requested and mandatory claims**

                When the user is authenticated to the application, claims
                that are indicated as required and/or mandatory in this
                claim configuration form will be displayed in the consent
                request UI to prompt for the user’s consent. If a claim is
                indicated as a mandatory claim, it will be indicated with a
                red color asterix ( \* ) when requesting consent. The user
                will not be able to proceed with authentication without
                providing consent for the mandatory claims.

                For more information about consent management during
                authentication, see [Consent Management with
                Single-Sign-On](../../learn/consent-management-with-single-sign-on).

2.  Select the **Subject Claim URI** and the **Role Claim URI** (for
    custom claims)from the drop-down. The claims you mapped are listed
    in the drop-down and you can choose among these claims.

    !!! info 
        -   **Subject Claim URI** defines the authenticated user identifier
            which will return with the authentication response to the
            service provider.
        -   **Role Claim URI** defines the role claim for the service
            provider. This is useful if you use a different claim as the
            role claim or if you define a custom claim mapping for the
            service provider.

!!! tip "Caching service provider claims"
    If you want to cache claim data, be sure to add a cache configuration
    similar to the following under
    `         <CacheManager name="IdentityApplicationManagementCacheManager">        `
    in the
    `         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/identity.xml        ` file:
    
    ``` java
    <Cache name="LocalClaimInvalidationCache" enable="true" timeout="300" capacity="5000" isDistributed="false"/>
    ```

    Here, you need to specify values as follows:

    -   `          timeout         ` : The cache timeout value in seconds.
    -   `          capacity         ` : The maximum cache size.
    -   `          isDistributed         ` : Set this to
        `          false         ` .
