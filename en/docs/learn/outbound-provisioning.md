# Outbound Provisioning

This topic provides instructions on how to provision users to a trusted
identity provider from the WSO2 Identity Server. A trusted identity
provider is basically an identity provider that supports inbound
provisioning. It can be Google, Salesforce, another Identity Server,
etc. For more information, see [Outbound
provisioning](Identity_Provisioning).

Outbound Provisioning involves sending provisioning requests from the
Identity Server to other external applications. See the following
document for more details on configuring outbound provisioning (SCIM
connector is used for example).
