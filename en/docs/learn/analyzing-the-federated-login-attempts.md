# Analyzing the Federated Login Attempts

The **Federated Login Attempts** statistical visualization displays
statistics relating to federated authentication.

A federated authentication is an authentication activity that is carried
out via a federated identity provider.

The successful authentication attempt for a single federated step is
considered a federated authentication success. Similarly, a failed
authentication attempt for a single federated step is considered a
federated authentication failure.

If there are multiple constituent steps, each federated authentication
step is considered separately. A failed federated authentication attempt
is counted as a failure only if a failed response is received from a
federated identity provider. There can be situation where federated
identity provider will not send the response back. Such are not counted
as authentication failure as the flow was broken in the middle.

The statistics displayed in this page include all
the federated login attempts that are performed via federated identity
providers over time as well as the local login attempts filtered based
on service providers, identity providers, and users

Follow the steps below to view the **Federated Login Attempts**.

    e.g., an area in darker green indicates more login attempts when
    compared to an area in lighter green.
-   The **toggle key** helps to switch from the success view and failure
    view.
