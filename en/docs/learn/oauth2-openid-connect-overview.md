# OAuth2-OpenID Connect

OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf
of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also
provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to
their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a
username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as
to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile,
and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about
authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is
extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as
encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session
management, when it makes sense for them.
