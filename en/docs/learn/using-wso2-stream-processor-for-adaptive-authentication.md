# Using WSO2 Stream Processor for Adaptive Authentication

WSO2 Stream Processor (SP) is a lightweight, lean, streaming SQL-based
stream processing platform that allows you to collect events, analyze
them in real-time, identify patterns, map their impacts, and communicate
the results within milliseconds.  It is powered by
[Siddhi](https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-quckstart-4.0/)
to be extremely high performing.

This tutorial demonstrates using WSO2 Stream Processor to publish
transactional data and assess an end user's risk score based on the
user's transaction history in an adaptive authentication scenario.
Consider a business use case where a bank wants to prompt an additional
authentication step when a user attempts to log in to the system after a
doing a transaction of over $10,000.This usecase can be achieved by
creating a Siddhi application in WSO2 SP and configuring a conditional
authentication script in the service provider configuration of the WSO2
Identity Server (WSO2 IS).

WSO2 SP has 4 main runtimes. This tutorial demonstrates the use of the
**Editor** runtime to create a Siddhi application and the **Worker**
runtime to run the script. Follow the instructions given in the sections
below to create and deploy a Siddhi application that can be used with
WSO2 Identity Server for risk-based login.

### Creating a Siddhi application

1.  Download the latest version of [WSO2 Stream
    Processor](https://github.com/wso2/product-sp/releases).
2.  Extract the downloaded zip and navigate to the
    `          <SP_HOME>/bin         ` directory (
    `          <SP_HOME>         ` is the extracted directory).
3.  Issue one of the following commands to start the WSO2 Stream
    Processor Studio.
    -   For Windows: `            editor.bat           `
    -   For Linux: ./ `            editor.sh           `
4.  Access the Stream Processor Studio through the following URL:
    http://\<HOST\_NAME\>:\<EDITOR\_PORT\>/editor.

    !!! info 
        The default URL is: <http://localhost:9390/editor>.

    The Stream Processor Studio opens as shown below.

5.  Click **New** to start creating a new Siddhi application.

6.  Enter a name for your Siddhi application. In this scenario, let's
    name the application `           RiskBasedLogin          ` as shown
    below.

    ``` java
    @App:name("RiskBasedLogin")
    ```

    ![sp-risk-based-login](../assets/img/tutorials/sp-risk-based-login.png)

7.  Add the following HTTP source to the Siddhi application.

	!!! info 
		Siddhi sources are usually asynchronous, which means you will
		receive an acknowledgement with a `            200 OK           `
		response when you publish an event to a source. The code block given
		below shows the sample HTTP source used in this tutorial. For more
		information, see [HTTP
		sources](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/).

    **Sample HTTP Source**

    ``` java
	@Source(type = 'http', receiver.url="http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream", basic.auth.enabled='false', @map(type='json', @attributes(username='$.event.username', transaction='$.event.transaction')))
	define stream TransactionInputStream (transaction double, username string);
    ```

    ??? note "Click to see more information about streams, sources, and sinks"

		**Streams**

		A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely
		identifiable name, and a set of defined attributes with specific
		data types defining its schema.

		**Sources**

		A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP,
		Kafka, HTTP, etc.,) in the form of events, then converts each event
		(which can be in XML, JSON, binary, etc. format) to a Siddhi event,
		and passes that to a Stream for processing.

		**Sink**

		A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a
		predefined data format (such as XML, JSON, binary, etc), and
		publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail, TCP, Kafka,
		HTTP, etc).

	![http-source-in-siddhi](../assets/img/tutorials/http-source-in-siddhi.png)

	In this tutorial, the source you just created is considered as the
	stream used to publish events about the transaction that a user has
	made.

8.  Click on **File\>Save** to save the application.

9.  Click **Run** or the play button
    ![sp-play](../assets/img/tutorials/sp-play.png) to run the script using the
    editor. If the application starts successfully, you will see the
    following log in the Stream Processor Studio console.

    ![sp-studio-console.png](../assets/img/tutorials/sp-studio-console.png)

10. Run the following cURL command on a new terminal window to test the
    source.  

    !!! tip
    
        Replace the \<username\> tag in the cURL command given
        below with the username of the user you have added in WSO2 Identity
        Server.
    

    ``` java
    curl -kv -X POST -u admin:admin \
      http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "event": {
            "username": "<username>",
            "transaction": 12000
        }
    }'
    ```

	You will receive a response similar to the response shown below.

    ``` java
	< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	< content-length: 0
	< server: wso2-http-transport
	< date: Wed, 6 Jun 2018 14:20:53 +0530
    ```
    
	!!! info 
		Since all sources in Siddhi are asynchronous, the client does not
		receive any data from events that are published to the source
		streams (i.e., the only response to the client is a
		`            200 OK           ` message). In this tutorial, the
		user's risk score needs to be calculated based on transactions that
		the user has made over the last five minutes. To achieve this, you
		must use an HTTP-request source and an HTTP-response sink. The
		HTTP-request source and HTTP-response sink always comes in pairs.

	  

		The difference between the normal HTTP source and an HTTP-request
		source is that the HTTP-request source sends a response event to the
		request using the matching HTTP-response sink.

11. Add the following HTTP-request source and HTTP-response sink.

    **HTTP-request source**

    ``` java
	@Source(type = 'http-request', source.id='testsource', basic.auth.enabled='true', parameters="'ciphers:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256', 'sslEnabledProtocols:TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2'", receiver.url="https://localhost:8280/RiskBasedLogin/InputStream", @map(type='json', @attributes(messageId='trp:messageId',username='$.event.username')))
	define stream InputStream (messageId string, username string);
    ```

    **HTTP-response sink**

    ``` java
	@sink(type='http-response', source.id='testsource', message.id='{{messageId}}', @map(type='json'))
	define stream OutputStream (messageId string, username string, riskScore int)
    ```

    !!! tip
    
        Note the following in the HTTP-request source and HTTP-response
        sink code blocks.
    
        -   The `             source.id            ` in the source stream
            and the sink stream is used to bridge one input stream to one
            output stream, and should be matching and unique in pair.
    
        -   In the source, you must have an attribute similiar to the
            `             messageId            ` shown in the code blocks
            above (the name of the attribute can be different). The
            attribute must be of type string and the value should be
            selected from `             trp:messageId.            `
    
        -   Maintain the `             messageId            ` attribute
            throughout the whole flow. The
            `             messageId            ` attribute should also be
            available in the sink stream.
    
        -   The HTTP-response type sink should have the option
            `             message.id            ` and the value should be
            the above mentioned `             messageId.            `
    

12. Add the following Siddhi query that is used to pass data from the
    source to the sink.

    ``` java
	define stream TempStream (messageId string, username string, sumTransactions double);

	from TransactionInputStream#window.time(5 min)
	right outer join InputStream#window.length(1) unidirectional 
	on TransactionInputStream.username == InputStream.username
	select InputStream.messageId, InputStream.username, sum(transaction) as sumTransactions
	group by messageId, InputStream.username
	insert into TempStream;

	from TempStream
	select messageId, username, ifThenElse(sumTransactions > 10000, 1, 0) as riskScore
	insert into OutputStream;
	```

13. The final Siddhi application is as follows.

    ``` java
	@App:name("RiskBasedLogin")
	@App:description("Description of the plan")

	@Source(type = 'http', receiver.url="http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream", basic.auth.enabled='false', @map(type='json', @attributes(username='$.event.username', transaction='$.event.transaction')))
	define stream TransactionInputStream (transaction double, username string);

	@Source(type = 'http-request', source.id='testsource', basic.auth.enabled='true', parameters="'ciphers:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256', 'sslEnabledProtocols:TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2'", receiver.url="https://localhost:8280/RiskBasedLogin/InputStream", @map(type='json', @attributes(messageId='trp:messageId',username='$.event.username')))
	define stream InputStream (messageId string, username string);

	@sink(type='http-response', source.id='testsource', message.id='{{messageId}}', @map(type='json'))
	define stream OutputStream (messageId string, username string, riskScore int);

	define stream TempStream (messageId string, username string, sumTransactions double);

	from TransactionInputStream#window.time(5 min)
	right outer join InputStream#window.length(1) unidirectional 
	on TransactionInputStream.username == InputStream.username
	select InputStream.messageId, InputStream.username, sum(transaction) as sumTransactions
	group by messageId, InputStream.username
	insert into TempStream;

	from TempStream
	select messageId, username, ifThenElse(sumTransactions > 10000, 1, 0) as riskScore
	insert into OutputStream;
    ```

You have successfully created the Siddhi application. Use the
instructions given in the next section to test it out.

### Testing the Siddhi application

1.  Run the Siddhi application from the **Editor**.

2.  Execute the following cURL command on a terminal window to calculate
    the user's risk score.

    ``` java
	curl -X POST  https://localhost:8280/RiskBasedLogin/InputStream -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
		"event": {
			"username": "admin"
		}
	}' -kv -u admin:admin
    ```

    You will see a response similar to the response given below.

    ``` java
    {"event":{"messageId":"6ec82e38-8c8a-47dd-b5e2-da3c55975766","username":"admin","riskScore":0}
    ```

3.  Execute the following cURL command to send an event about a
    transaction made by the user.

    ``` java
	curl -kv -X POST http://localhost:8281/RiskBasedLogin/TransactionInputStream -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
		"event": {
			"username": "admin",
			"transaction": 12000
		}
	}'
    ```

4.  Next, execute the same cURL command you executed in step 1 to
    re-evaluate the risk score after a new transaction was added.

    ``` java
	curl -X POST  https://localhost:8280/RiskBasedLogin/InputStream -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d '{
		"event": {
			"username": "admin"
		}
	}' -kv -u admin:admin
    ```

    You will receive a response similar to the response given below.

    ``` java
    "event":{"messageId":"6ec82e38-8c8a-47dd-b5e2-da3c55975766","username":"admin","riskScore":1}}
    ```

    Note that the user's risk score has now changed to 1.

### Configuring the analytics engine in WSO2 IS

This section demonstrates how to configure the analytics engine in WSO2
Identity Server that establishes the connection between WSO2 Identity
Server and WSO2 Stream Processor.

1.  Start the WSO2 Identity Server and log in to the management console
    using admin/admin credentials.
2.  Click **Resident** under **Identity Providers** and expand
    **Adaptive Engine\>Analytics Engine**.
3.  Configure the following properties accordingly. For this tutorial
    scenario, you can leave the default configurations as they are.  
    ![analytics-engine-properties](../assets/img/tutorials/analytics-engine-properties.png)

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Target Host</td>
    <td>The target hostname and target port for the WSO2 SP endpoint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Enable Basic Authentication</td>
    <td>Select to enable authentication with username and password credentials.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>User ID</td>
    <td>The username of the WSO2 SP admin.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Secret</td>
    <td>The password of the WSO2 SP admin.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>HTTP Connection Timeout</td>
    <td>The connection timeout interval in milliseconds. If the endpoint does not respond within this time, the connection attempt has failed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>HTTP Read Timeout</td>
    <td>The timeout interval in milliseconds for each call of <code>               read()              </code> on the <code>               InputStream              </code> . If the server does not respond with data within this time, the connection is terminated.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>HTTP Connection Request Timeout</td>
    <td>The timeout interval in milliseconds for requesting a connection with WSO2 SP.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Hostname Verification</td>
    <td>Possible values are: STRICT or ALLOW_ALL.<br />
    <strong>STRICT</strong> - When this mode is enabled, hostnames will be strictly verified against the hostname specified in the product's SSL certificate. For example, if "*. <a href="http://foo.com/">foo.com</a> " is specified as the hostname in the certificate, only this specific hostname is authorized by the server. That is, subdomains such as " <a href="http://a.b.foo.com/">a.b.foo.com</a> " or ip addresses such as "127.10.11.1" will <strong>not</strong> be authorized. <strong>ALLOW_ALL</strong> - This option turns off hostname verification for the server. Note that this is not recommended in a production setup and should only be used for demonstrations and testing.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

4.  An HTTP connection is used to communicate between WSO2 IS and WSO2
    SP. Therefore, you must add the certificate of WSO2 SP to WSO2 IS.
    Follow the steps given below to import the certificate from WSO2 SP
    to WSO2 IS. This example uses the default keystores and
    certificates.

    1.  Navigate to the
        `             <SP_HOME>/resources/security            `
        directory on a new terminal window and run the following
        command.

        ``` java
        keytool -export -alias wso2carbon -keystore wso2carbon.jks -file sp.pem
        ```

    2.  Navigate to the
        `             <IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security            `
        directory and run the following command.

        !!! info 
			Replace the `              <SP_HOME>             ` placeholder
			in the command with the filepath location of your
			`              <SP_HOME>             ` folder.

        ``` java
        keytool -import -alias certalias -file <SP_HOME>/resources/security/sp.pem -keystore client-truststore.jks -storepass wso2carbon
        ```

### Deploying the Siddhi application

You have successfully created the Siddhi application and tested the
functionality using the **Editor**. The **Editor** is useful for
testing purposes however, you must deploy the application properly in
WSO2 SP to use it in production. Follow these instructions to deploy the
application.

1.  On the Editor, click **File\>Export File**.
2.  A file named
    `                     RiskBasedLogin.siddhi                   ` is
    downloaded onto your machine. Place it in the
    `          <SP_HOME>/deployment/siddhi-files         ` directory.
3.  Port offset the 9443 port in WSO2 Stream Processor. This is required
    because WSO2 IS also runs on the 9443 port.

    1.  Open the `             deployment.yaml            ` file found
        in the `             <SP_HOME>/conf/worker/            ` folder.

    2.  Change the `             Port: 9443            ` to
        `              9444             ` under
        `             listenerConfigurations            ` .

        ``` java
	  	listenerConfigurations:
		-
		  id: "default"
		  host: "0.0.0.0"
		  port: 9090
		-
		  id: "msf4j-https"
		  host: "0.0.0.0"
		  port: 9444
		  scheme: https
		  keyStoreFile: "${carbon.home}/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks"
		  keyStorePassword: wso2carbon
		  certPass: wso2carbon
        ```

4.  Stop the **Editor** and start WSO2 Stream Processor in a **Worker**
    profile.  
    -   For Windows: `            worker.bat           `
    -   For Linux: ./ `            worker.sh           `

### What's Next?

Now that you have successfully deployed a Siddhi application for risk
based login, you can configure WSO2 Identity Server to receive data from
this Siddhi application and set up rules for adaptive authentication.
Follow the [Configuring Risk-Based Adaptive
Authentication](../../learn/configuring-risk-based-adaptive-authentication)
tutorial to set this up.
