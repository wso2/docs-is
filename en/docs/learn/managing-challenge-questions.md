# Managing Challenge Questions

A main part of account recovery is setting up challenge or security
questions for user accounts. With the WSO2 Identity Server, you can set
up challenge questions in different languages using one of the following
methods:

The following tutorial guides you through a sample scenario of setting
up a set of challenge questions for password recovery. Follow the
instructions to set up.

### Adding a challenge question set

1.  Start the Identity Server and log in to the management console using
    admin/admin credentials.
2.  Navigate to the **Main** tab and click on **Add** under **Challenge
    Questions.**
3.  Click **Add New Challenge Question Set** and fill in the following
    fields to add a new set of challenge questions.

    !!! info 
        When adding a new challenge question set, you have to add the first
        challenge question of the set along with it.

    | Field                     | Description                                                                                                                              | Sample Value    |
    |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
    | Challenge Question Set Id | This is a text field that enables you to specify the question set Id. This Id can only contain alpha numeric characters.                 | Set1            |
    | Challenge Question Id     | This text field allows you to enter the question Id of the first question in the set. This Id can only contain alpha numeric characters. | Q1              |
    | Challenge Question Locale | This dropdown field enables you to select the language the challenge question will appear in.                                            | Spanish         |
    | Add Challenge Question    | Add the first challenge question of the set.                                                                                             | Place of birth? |

#### Claim mapping for the challenge question set

For each challenge question set that you create, create claims to store
the answers to the questions in the set. To do this, follow the steps
below.

1.  After clicking the **Add** button, the screen that appears will
    contain the fully qualified name of the challenge question set. In
    the example above, the **Set Id** is **"Set1",** therefore the fully
    qualified name of the set is http://wso2.org/claims/Set1.
2.  Navigate to **Claims\>Add** and click **Add Local Claim**.
3.  Enter the following details and select the **Supported by Default**
    checkbox to map the challenge question set to a claim in the user
    store. Click **Add**.

    !!! tip
    
        **Tip:** Since the first challenge question of the set was "Place of
        birth?", in this example the mapped attribute of the PRIMARY user
        store is "location".
    

    -   **Claim URI:** http://wso2.org/claims/Set1
    -   **Display Name:** Challenge Question Set 1
    -   **Description:** xxx
    -   **Mapped Attribute-User Store Domain Name:** PRIMARY
    -   **Mapped Attribute-Mapped Attribute:** location
