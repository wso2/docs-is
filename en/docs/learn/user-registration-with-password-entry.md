# User Registration with Password Entry

[Registering users](../../learn/user-registraion) with password entry is an [account management](../../learn/managing-user-accounts) feature offered by WSO2 Identity Server. 

In this approach, an administrator first creates a user account in the system upon which a confirmation link will be emailed to the userâ€™s registered email Id. Once the user clicks on the confirmation link, the user will be taken into a screen prompting to enter the password. Once the user enters the correct password, the user account gets activated. 

## Scenario

**Pickup** is a cab company that has many employees who use different credentials to sign in to different internal enterprise applications. While **Robert** is an administrator at Pickup, **Jane** is a new recruit. 

Robert wants to register a user account for Jane and get it activated by requesting Jane to enter a password.

Let's learn how it's done! 

## Set up  

Follow the steps below to configure WSO2 Identity Server to enable password entry for account confirmation.

1.	Open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

	1.	To request password entry from the users who are registered via Management Console, add the following configurations. 

		```toml
		[identity_mgt.user_onboarding]
		ask_password_from_user= true
		```

	2.	To configure the email server to send emails requesting passwor entry, add the following configurations.

		-	**from_address**: This is the email address from which the confirmation email will be sent.
		-	**username**: This is the user name of the given email address.
		-	**password**: This is the password of the given email address. 

		```toml tab="Format"
		[output_adapter.email]
		from_address= ""
		username= ""
		password= ""
		hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
		port= 587
		enable_start_tls= true
		enable_authentication= true
		```

		```toml tab="Sample"
		[output_adapter.email]
		from_address= "wso2iamtest@gmail.com"
		username= "wso2iamtest"
		password= "Wso2@iam70"
		hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
		port= 587
		enable_start_tls= true
		enable_authentication= true
		```

		!!! warning "If you are using a Google email account"

			Google has restricted third-party applications and less secure applications from sending emails by default. As WSO2 Identity Server acts as a third-party application when sending emails for password entry, follow the steps below to enable your Google email account to provide access to third-party applications.

			1.	Access [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).

			2.	Under **Signing in to Google** section, turn off the **2-step Verification** option.

2.	[Restart WSO2 Identity Server]((../../setup/running-the-product/)).

3.	Sign in to the WSO2 Identity Server [Management Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console/) at `https://<SERVER_HOST>:9443/carbon` as an administrator. 	 

4.	On the **Main** menu of the Management Console, click **Identity > Identity Providers > Resident**.
