# Configuring a Read-write Active Directory User Store

WSO2 identity server uses an embedded Read/Write LDAP as the primary user store.
This document will guide you to change that to a Read Write Active Directory user store.

!!! tip 
    Please read the topic [Configuring User Stores](../../setup/configuring-user-stores) to get a high-level understanding of the user stores available in WSO2
    Identity Server (WSO2 IS).
    
!!! tip    
    For Read-only Active Directory User Store manager configuration, use Read-only LDAP user store manager configuration properties.

## Configuring Read-write Active Directory user store manager  

Following are the minimum configurations that are needed to be provided to configure Read-write Active Directory user store manager.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Configuration Name</th>
<th>Display Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr class="even">
<td>type</td>
<td>User Store Type</td>
<td>Type of the user store manager that we are using.For Read-only LDAP user store manager this value
should be active_directory.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>base_dn</td>
<td>User Search Base</td>
<td>DN of the context or object under which the user entries are stored in the user store. When the user store searches for users, it will start from this location of the directory<br />
Sample values: ou=Users,dc=wso2,dc=org</td>
</tr>
</table>

Following are the minimum user store properties that need to be provided to configure Read-only LDAP user store manager.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Property Id</th>
<th>Primary User Store Property</th>
<th>Secondary User Store Property </th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr class="even">
<td>ConnectionURL</td>
<td>connection_url</td>
<td>Connection URL</td>
<td><p>Connection URL to the user store server. In the case of default LDAP in Carbon, the port is specified in the carbon.xml file, and a reference to that port is included in this configuration.</p>
<p>Sample values:<br />
<a href="ldap://10.100.1.100:389">ldap://10.100.1.100:389</a><br />

The value you specify is used as the DN (Distinguish Name) attribute of the user who has sufficient permissions to perform operations on users and roles in LDAP</p>
<p>This property is mandatory.<br />

<tr class="even">

Replace the default `user_store` configuration in the `         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml        
` file, as per your active directory configuration. A sample configuration is given below.

```toml
[user_store]
type = "active_directory"
base_dn = "cn=Users,dc=wso2,dc=org"
connection_url = "ldaps://10.100.1.102:639"
connection_name = "cn=admin,ou=system"
connection_password = "admin"
```
## Properties used in Read-write Active Directory userstore manager

The following table lists the properties used in Read-write Active
Directory and their descriptions:

Any of  the following properties can be configured for the `PRIMARY` user store by adding them as follows to 
`<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`.

``` toml
[user_store]
<Property-Name> = <Property-Value>
```
For example :

``` toml
[user_store]
scim_enabled = true
```

!!! tip 
    The properties given below can be configured for a secondary user store through the management console.

PLAIN_TEXT - Plain text passwords.(Default)</p>
<p>If you just configure as SHA, It is considered as SHA-1, It is always better to configure algorithm with higher bit value as digest bit size would be increased.<br />
<br />
Most of the LDAP servers (such as OpenLdap, OpenDJ, AD, ApacheDS and etc..) are supported to store password as salted hashed values (SSHA)<br />
Therefore WSO2IS server just wants to feed password into the connected user store as a plain text value. Then LDAP user store can store them as salted hashed value. To feed the plain text into the LDAP server, you need to set PasswordHashMethod to “PLAIN_TEXT”<br />
But; if your LDAP does not support to store user password as hashed values. You can configure WSO2 server to hash the password and feeds the hashed password into the LDAP server. Then you need to configure PasswordHashMethod property with SHA (SHA-1), SHA-256, SHA-512. Please note WSO2 server cannot create a salted hashed password (SSHA) to feed into the LDAP.</p></td>
