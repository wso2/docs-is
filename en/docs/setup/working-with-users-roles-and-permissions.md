# Working with Users, Roles and Permissions

The user management functionality allows you to configure the users that
can access your product and the permissions that determine how each user
can work with your system.

The default user management configuration in WSO2 Identity Server is as
follows:

-   The default H2 database in the WSO2 Identity Server is configured as
    the User Store that stores all the information on users, roles and
    permissions.
-   An **Admin** user and **Admin** password are configured by default.
-   The default **Admin** role connected to the **Admin** user has all
    permissions granted.

According to the default configuration explained above, you can simply
log into the management console of the product with the **Admin** user
and get started right away.

Follow the links given below to understand how user management works in
WSO2 products, and for step-by-step instructions on how to change/update
