# Getting Started with the Management Console

The WSO2 Identity Server Management Console is a Web-based User
Interface. It allows users to interact with a running Identity Server
instance, without having to intervene with any underlying
configuration files. The controls in the Management Console are usually
self-explanatory. **This page provides some additional insight on
what can be configured via the management console** **EDIT THIS**. 

The following screen depicts the home screen of the management console.

The main menu items of the console appear in the left hand side of the 
home screen. Each of these menus carry a list of sub menus. These menus and subsections will 
navigate you via different configurations and features. The usable features for each
sub section will appear in the middle of the screen. 

The Management Console provides a list of tools and
features that you can use. These are divided among the following menu items.

    product version and any additional feature you have installed to provision the
