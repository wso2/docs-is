# Installing on Linux or OS X

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    See the [environment compatibility](../../setup/environment-compatibility)
    to find out if this version of the product is fully tested on your
    operating system.
    

Follow the instructions below to install WSO2 Identity Server on Linux
or Mac OS X.

### Installing the required applications

1.  Log in to the command line (Terminal on Mac).

2.  Ensure that your system meets the [Installation Prerequisites](../../setup/installation-prerequisites).  Java Development Kit
    (JDK) is essential to run the product.

### Installing the Identity Server

1.  Download the latest version of the Identity Server from
    <http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/> .
2.  Extract the archive file to a dedicated directory for the Identity
    Server, which will hereafter be referred to as
    `           <IS_HOME>          ` .

    !!! warning
    
        If you are using Mac OS with High Sierra, you may encounter the
        following warning message when logging in to the management console
        due to a compression issue that exists in the High Sierra SDK.
    
        ``` java
        WARN {org.owasp.csrfguard.log.JavaLogger} -  potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack thwarted (user:<anonymous>, ip:xxx.xxx.xx.xx, method:POST, uri:/carbon/admin/login_action.jsp, error:required token is missing from the request)
        ```
    
        To avoid this issue, 
        1. Open the 'deployment.toml' file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/` directory.
        2. Set the `compression` element under the HTTPS connector configuration to `off`.
           ```
           [transport.https]
           ...
           compression="off"
           ...           
           ```
        3. Restart WSO2 Identity Server.
    

### Setting up JAVA_HOME

You must set your `         JAVA_HOME        ` environment variable to
point to the directory where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed
on the computer.

!!! info
    Environment variables are global system variables accessible by all the processes running under the operating system.

1.  In your home directory, open the BASHRC file (.bash\_profile file 
    on Mac) using editors such as vi, emacs, pico, or mcedit.
2.  Assuming you have JDK 1.8.0\_141 in your system, add the following
    two lines at the bottom of the file, replacing
    `           /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_141          ` with the actual
    directory where the JDK is installed.

    ``` java
    On Linux:
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_141
    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
     
    On OS X:
    export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_141/Contents/Home
    ```

3.  Save the file.

    !!! info
        If you do not know how to work with text editors in a Linux SSH session, run the following command: `            cat >> .bashrc.           ` Paste the string from the clipboard and press "Ctrl+D."

4.  To verify that the `           JAVA_HOME          ` variable is set
    correctly, execute the following command:

    ``` java
    On Linux:
    echo $JAVA_HOME
         
    On OS X:
    which java

    If the above command gives you a path like /usr/bin/java, then it is a symbolic link to the real location. To get the real location, run the following:
    ls -l `which java`
    ```

5.  The system returns the JDK installation path.

### Setting system properties

If you need to set additional system properties when the server starts,
you can take the following approaches:

-   **Set the properties from a script** : Setting your system
    properties in the startup script is ideal, because it ensures that
    you set the properties every time you start the server. To avoid
    having to modify the script each time you upgrade, the best approach
    is to create your own startup script that wraps the WSO2 startup
    script and adds the properties you want to set, rather than editing
    the WSO2 startup script directly.
-   **Set the properties from an external registry** : If you want to
    access properties from an external registry, you could create Java
    code that reads the properties at runtime from that registry. Be
    sure to store sensitive data such as username and password to
    connect to the registry in a properties file instead of in the Java
    code and secure the properties file with the [secure
    vault](../../administer/carbon-secure-vault-implementation).

You are now ready to [run the product](../../setup/running-the-product).
