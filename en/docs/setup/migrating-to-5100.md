# Migrating to 5.10.0

!!! note "Before you begin"
    -   Make sure you satisfy the prerequisites in [Before you begin](../../setup/migration-guide).
    -   Carry out the pre-processing steps in [Preparing for migration](../../setup/migrating-preparing-for-migration).

!!! note ""
    In this section, `<OLD_IS_HOME> ` is the directory that the current Identity
    Server resides in, and `<NEW_IS_HOME>` is the
    directory that WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 resides in.

    Move indexes to the TS32K Tablespace. The index tablespace in the 
    `           IDN_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN          `  and 
    `           IDN_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_CODE          ` tables need
    to be moved to the existing TS32K tablespace in order to support
    newly added table indexes.
    SQLADM or DBADM authority is required in order to invoke
    the `           ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE          ` stored procedure. You
    must also have the appropriate object creation authorities,
    including authorities to issue the **SELECT** statement on the source
    table, and to issue the **INSERT** statement on the target table.

1.  If you have manually added any custom OSGI bundles to the
    `          <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins         `
    directory, copy those OSGI bundles to the
    `          <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins         `
    directory.
    
    !!! warning "Important" 
        You may need to update the custom components to work with WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0. 
        Refer [Migrating custom components](../../setup/migrating-preparing-for-migration/#migrating-custom-components).
        If applicable, migrate
        [Data Publishers](../../setup/migrating-data-publishers) and
        [Custom Scope validators](../../setup/migrating-custom-scope-validators).

2.  If you have manually added any JAR files to the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib          `
    directory, copy and paste those JARs in the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib          `
    directory.

3.  Copy the `           .jks          ` files from the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security          `
    directory and paste them in the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security          `
    directory.

    !!! note
        In WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0, it is required to use a certificate with the RSA key size greater than 2048. If you have used a certificate that has a weak RSA key (key size less than 2048) in the previous IS version, add the following configuration to `<NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` to configure internal and primary keystores. 

        ```toml
        [keystore.primary]
        file_name = "primary.jks"
        type = "JKS"
        password = "wso2carbon"
        alias = "wso2carbon"
        key_password = "wso2carbon"

        [keystore.internal]
        file_name = "internal.jks"
        type = "JKS"
        password = "wso2carbon"
        alias = "wso2carbon"
        key_password = "wso2carbon"
        ```

        Make sure to point the internal keystore to the keystore that is copied from the previous WSO2 Identity Server version. The primary keystore can be pointed to a keystore with a certificate that has a strong RSA key.

4.  If you have created tenants in the previous WSO2 Identity Server
    version that contain resources, copy the content from `          <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/tenants         ` directory,
    to the `          <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/tenants         ` directory.
    
5.  If you have created secondary user stores in the previous WSO2 IS
    version, copy the content in the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/userstores          `
    directory to the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/userstores          `
    directory.
    
6. Ensure that you have migrated the configurations into the new version as
   advised in [preparing for migration section.](../../setup/migrating-preparing-for-migration/#migrating-the-configurations)
   
7. Migrate [Log4j2 configurations](../../setup/migrating-to-log4j2).

8. Replace the `<NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/conf/email/email-admin-config.xml` file with
   `<OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/conf/email/email-admin-config.xml`.   
    
9. Follow the steps given below to perform database updates:
    1.     To download the **migration resources**, visit [the latest release tag](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-migration-resources/releases/latest) and download the wso2is-migration-x.x.x.zip under **Assets**. Unzip it to a local directory.
        
        !!! Note 
            - **x.x.x** of `wso2is-migration-x.x.x.zip` denotes the
            version number of the most recently-released migration resources. 
            - The
            directory where the `wso2is-migration-x.x.x.zip` is unziped
            will be referred to as ` <IS_MIGRATION_TOOL_HOME> `.

    2.   Copy the ` org.wso2.carbon.is.migration-x.x.x.jar ` file in the
        ` <IS_MIGRATION_TOOL_HOME>/dropins ` directory into the ` <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins `
        directory.

    3.  Copy migration-resources directory to the
        `             <NEW_IS_HOME>            ` root directory.

    4.  Ensure that the property values are as follows in the
        `  <NEW_IS_HOME>/migration-resources/migration-config.yaml ` file.

        ``` java
        migrationEnable: "true"

        currentVersion: "5.7.0"

        migrateVersion: "5.10.0"
        ```
        
        !!! note
            Here, the `currentVersion` is the current WSO2 Identity Server version that you are using.

    ??? note "If you are using PostgreSQL"
        During the migration, "uuid-ossp" extension is created in the database. In order to create this extension, 
        the database user should have the '**Superuser**' permission. 
        If the user is not already a superuser, assign the permission before starting the migration.
            
            ALTER USER <user> WITH SUPERUSER;

10. If you are migrating your user stores to the new user store managers with the unique ID capabilities, Follow 
    the guidelines given in the [Migrating User Store Managers](../../setup/migrating-userstore-managers) before moving to the next section.
            
11.  Start the WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 with the following command to
    execute the migration client.

    1.  Linux/Unix:

        ```bash 
        sh wso2server.sh -Dmigrate -Dcomponent=identity
        ```

    2.  Windows:

        ```bash
        wso2server.bat -Dmigrate -Dcomponent=identity
        ```

12.  Stop the server once the migration client execution is complete.
    
## Executing the sync tool

!!! warning
    Proceed with this step only if you have opted in for [Zero down time migration](../../setup/migrating-preparing-for-migration/#zero-down-time-migration).
    If not, your migration task is complete now. You can omit the following steps.
    
1.  Start the data sync tool with the following command pointing to the `sync.properties` file. 
This will start syncing data created in the old WSO2 Identity Server database after taking the database dump 
to the new WSO2 Identity Server database.
    ```bash
    sh wso2server.sh -DsyncData -DconfigFile=<path to sync.properties file>/sync.properties
    ```

2.  Monitor the logs in the sync tool to see how many entries are synced at a given time and to keep track of the progress in the data sync process. The following line will be printed in the logs in each table you have specified, that has no data to be synced.

    ```tab="Sample"
    [2019-02-27 17:26:32,388]  INFO {org.wso2.is.data.sync.system.pipeline.process.BatchProcessor} -  No data to sync for: <TABLE_NAME>
    ```
    
    !!! info
        If you have some traffic to the old version of the WSO2 Identity Server, the number of entries to 
        be synced might not become zero at any time. In that case, observe the logs to decide on a point 
        where the number of entries that are synced is low.

3.  When the data sync is complete, switch the traffic from the old setup to the new setup.

4.  Allow the sync client to run for some time to sync the entries that were not synced before switching 
the deployments. When the number of entries synced by the sync tool becomes zero, stop the sync client.
    
## Verifying the migration

After the migration is complete, proceed to the following verification steps.

+   Monitor the system health (CPU, memory usage etc).
+   Monitor the WSO2 logs to see if there are errors logged in the log files.
+   Run functional tests against the migrated deployment to verify that all the functionalies are working as expected.

If you see any problems in the migrated system, revert the traffic back to the previous setup and 
investigate the problem.
