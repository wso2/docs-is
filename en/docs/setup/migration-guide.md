# Migrating to 5.9.0

This section walks you through the steps you need to follow to upgrade
WSO2 Identity Server to version 5.9.0.Â In this
section, `         <OLD_IS_HOME>        ` is the directory that current Identity
Server resides in, and `         <NEW_IS_HOME>        ` is the
directory that WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 resides in. 

### Should I migrate?

WSO2 recommends upgrading to the latest version in order to ensure that
users receive the latest updates for the product.

-   For a high level overview of what has been added, changed, or
    deprecated in this release, see [About this
    release](../../get-started/about-this-release).
-   For a detailed overview of behavioral changes in this release, see
    [What Has Changed](../setup/migrating-what-has-changed).
    
### Prerequisites

#### Disabling versioning in the registry configuration
If there are frequently updating registry properties, having the versioning enabled for 
registry resources in the registry can lead to unnecessary growth in the registry related
tables in the database. To avoid this, with WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 we have disabled 
versioning by default.

Therefore, when migrating to IS 5.9.0 it is **required** to turn off the registry versioning in your
current WSO2 Identity Server and run the below scripts against the database that is used by the registry.
Alternatively it is possible to turn on registry versioning in IS 5.9.0 and continue. But this is
highly not recommended and these configurations should only be changed once.

!!! info "Turning off registry versioning in your current IS and running the scripts"
    Open the `registry.xml` file in the `<OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.
    Set the `versioningProperties`, `versioningComments`, `versioningTags` and `versioningRatings`
    false.
    
    ```
    <staticConfiguration>
          <versioningProperties>false</versioningProperties>
          <versioningComments>false</versioningComments>
          <versioningTags>false</versioningTags>
          <versioningRatings>false</versioningRatings>
    </staticConfiguration>
    ```
    
    !!! warning
        If the above configurations are already set as false you should not run the below scripts.
    
    When these configurations are turned off we need to remove the versioning detatils from the
    database in order for the registry resources to work properly. Choose the relevant DB type and run the
    script against the DB that the registry resides in.

### Preparing for migration

Follow this guide before you begin migration.

1.  Review what has been changed in this release. For a detailed list of
    changesÂ from 5.8.0 to 5.9.0, see
    [What Has Changed](../setup/migrating-what-has-changed) .

2.  This release is a WUM-only release. This means that there are no
    manual patches. You can use WSO2 Update Manager (WUM) to get any
    fixes or latest updates for this release.

    **If you are upgrading to use this version in your production
    environment** , use WSO2 Update Manager to get the latest updates
    available for WSO2 IS 5.9.0. For more information on how to use WSO2
    Update Manager, see [Updating WSO2
    Products](https://docs.wso2.com/display/updates/Using+WSO2+Update+Manager).

3.  Take a backup of the existing database used by the current WSO2 Identity Server. 
    This backup is necessary in case the migration causes issues in the existing database.

4.  Download WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 and unzip it in the `<NEW_IS_HOME>` directory.

### Migrating custom components

In WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 we have done a major upgrade to our kernel and our main components. 
Any custom OSGI bundles which are added manually should be recompiled with new dependency versions that are relevant 
to the new WSO2 IS version.  All custom OSGI components reside in the `<OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins` directory.

1.  Get the source codes of the custom OSGI components located in the dropins directory. 

2.  Change the dependency versions in the relevant POM files according to the WSO2 IS version that 
    you are upgrading to, and compile them. The compatible dependency versions can be found 
    [here](https://github.com/wso2/product-is/blob/v5.9.0-rc1/pom.xml). 

3.  If you come across any compile time errors, refer to the WSO2 IS code base and make the 
    necessary changes related to that particular component version.

4.  Add the compiled JAR files to the `<NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins` directory.

5.  If there were any custom OSGI components in `<OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib` directory, 
    add newly compiled versions of those components to the `<NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib`  directory.
    
!!! warning âlog4j Versionâ
WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 switched from log4j to log4j2. If any custom components are already using 
`carbon.logging` jar for logging purposes, make sure to update the custom components for logging to work 
with log4j2. For instructions, see [Migrating to log4j2](../../setup/migrating-to-log4j2).


### Migrating the configurations

Previous WSO2 Identity Server versions supported multiple configuration files 
such as <code>carbon.xml</code>, <code>identity.xml</code>, and <code>axis2.xml</code>. With the new 
configuration model in WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0, configurations are handled by the a single file named 
`deployment.toml` in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

Refer to the relevant feature documents and [What Has Changed](../setup/migrating-what-has-changed.md)
to add the necessary configurations according to the new configuration model.

!!! info
    If you have a WSO2 Subscription it is highly recommended to reach WSO2 Support
    before attempting to proceed with the configuration migration.
    
### Migrating the embedded LDAP user store

WSO2 does not recommend using the embedded LDAP userstore that is
shipped with WSO2 Identity Server in a production environment. However,
if migration of the embedded LDAP is required, follow the instructions
below to migrate the existing WSO2 IS LDAP user store to the new version
of WSO2 IS.

1.  Copy the `          <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/data         ` folder
    to `          <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/data         ` folder.
2.  Restart the server to save the changes.

### Zero down time migration

!!! info
    If you do not require a zero down time migration then you can directly proceed to the
    next section [Executing the migration client](#executing-the-migration-client).
    
A typical WSO2 Identity Server deployment requires an update or upgrade from time to time; 
usually when thereâs a patch, or critical security upgrade for products used in the solution, 
or an upgrade to a newer version. To address this situation while avoiding downtime, system 
admins and DevOps follow blue-green deployments to roll out updates.

??? Info "Blue-Green Migration"
    ![blue-green-migration](../assets/img/setup/blue-green-wso2-identity-server.png)
    
    A blue-green deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software. 
    Blue-green deployments require two identical hardware environments that are 
    configured the same way. While one environment is live and serving all production 
    traffic, the other environment remains idle. In the diagram below, the blue 
    environment is live and the green is idle.
    
    As you prepare a new version of WSO2 Identity Server to be deployed into production, 
    the final stage of testing takes place in an environment that is idle, i.e., in 
    this example, the green environment. Once you have deployed and fully tested the 
    deployment in green, you switch the load balancer so all incoming requests now 
    go to green instead of blue. The green environment is now live, and blue is idle.
    
This guide provides instructions to do a blue-green deployment with mission-critical services 
enabled in the deployment. At the moment WSO2 allows,
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication with</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle; padding-left: 25px;">
            <li>OAuth 2.0 / OIDC</li>
            <li>SAML 2</li>
            <li>WS-Federation (Passive)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
Data created when using the above-mentioned services are synced from the old system to the new system. 
All the other data will not be preserved in the new system.

Now let's see how to do the blue-green deployment with WSO2 Identity Server.

1.  Create new databases for the new WSO2 Identity Server version (5.9.0) 
    that you are migrating to.
2.  Unzip a WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 distribution (use a WUM updated distribution 
    if possible). This will be used as the data sync tool between the Identity 
    Server versions. We will refer to this WSO2 Identity Server distribution as 
    â**data sync tool**â and location as `<SYNC-TOOL-HOME>`.
3.  Copy the [sync client jar]() file to the `<SYNC-TOOL-HOME>/repository/components/dropins` directory.
4.  Replace the `log4j2.properties` file located in `<SYNC-TOOL-HOME>/repository/conf` 
    with the log4j2.properties file from [here](../assets/attachments/migration/log4j2.properties). This will create a separate log 
    file `syn.log` in the `<SYNC-TOOL-HOME>/repository/logs` directory which will contain the sync 
    tool related logs.
5.  Add the data sources used in **source** and **target** WSO2 Identity Server deployments involved in the migration 
    to `deployment.toml` file located `<SYNC-TOOL-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`.

8.  Start the sync tool with below command.
    +   If you want to create the required tables and triggers directly on the database.
        ```bash
        sh wso2server.sh -DprepareSync -DconfigFile=<path to sync.properties file>/sync.properties
        ```
    +   If you want to generate the DDL scripts for the required tables and triggers 
        (after generating you need to manually execute them on the database).
        ```bash
        sh wso2server.sh -DprepareSync -DgenerateDDL -DconfigFile=<path to sync.properties file>/sync.properties
        ```
    This will generate the required triggers and the metadata tables to sync the data between the databases used for 
    the 2 versions of the identity server. At the moment below tables are supported to be synced.
        +   IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA
        +   IDN_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN
        +   IDN_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE
        +   IDN_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_CODE
    
9.  Create database dumps from the old databases (databases used in the old version of the WSO2 Identity Server) and restore 
    in the new databases created.    


### Executing the migration client

To upgrade to the latest version of WSO2 Identity Server, you need to
upgrade the userstore database. Note that there are no registry schema
changes between versions.

Follow the steps below to perform the upgrade.
    
??? note "If you are using DB2"
    Move indexes to the the
    TS32K Tablespace. The index tablespace in the '
    `           IDN_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN          ` ' and '
    `           IDN_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_CODE          ` ' tables need
    to beÂ movedÂ to the existing TS32K tablespace in order to support
    newly added table indexes.

    SQLADM or DBADM authority is required in order to invoke
    the `           ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE          ` stored procedure. You
    must also have the appropriate object creation authorities,
    including authorities to issue the SELECT statement on the source
    table and to issue the INSERT statement on the target table.

1.  Do the following database updates:  
    1.  Download the [migration resources](../../assets/attachments/wso2is-5.8.0-migration.zip)
        and unzip it to a local directory. This directory is referred to
        as `             <IS5.9.0_MIGRATION_TOOL_HOME>            ` .

    2.  Copy the
        `             org.wso2.carbon.is.migration-5.9.0.jar            `
        and the `             snakeyaml-1.16.0.wso2v1.jar            `
        found in the
        `             <IS5.9.0_MIGRATION_TOOL_HOME>/dropins            `
        directory, and paste it inÂ the
        `             <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins            `
        directory.

    3.  Copy migration-resourcesÂ directory to the
        `             <NEW_IS_HOME>            ` root directory.

    4.  Ensure that the following property values are as follows in the
        `             migration-config.yaml            ` file found in
        the `             <NEW_IS_HOME>/migration-resources            `
        directory.

        ``` java
        migrationEnable: "true"

        currentVersion: "5.8.0"

        migrateVersion: "5.9.0"
        ```
        
        !!! note
            Here the `currentVersion` is the current WSO2 Identity Server version your using.

2.  If you manually added any custom OSGI bundles to the
    `          <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins         `
    directory, copy those toÂ the
    `          <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins         `
    directory.
3.  If you manually added any JAR files to the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib          `
    directory, copy thoseÂ and paste in the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib          `
    directory.

4.  Copy the `           .jks          ` files from the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security          `
    directory and paste in the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security          `
    directory.

5.  If you have created tenants in the previous WSO2 Identity Server
    version and if there are any resources in the
    `          <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/tenants         ` directory,
    copy the content to the
    `          <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/tenants         ` directory.
6.  If you have created secondary user stores inÂ the previous WSO2 IS
    version, copy the content in the
    `           <OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/userstores          `
    directory to the
    `           <NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/userstores          `
    directory.

7.  Start the WSO2 Identity ServerÂ 5.9.0Â with the following command to
    execute the migration client.

    1.  Linux/Unix:

        ```bash 
        sh wso2server.sh -Dmigrate -Dcomponent=identity
        ```

    2.  Windows:

        ```bash
        wso2server.bat -Dmigrate -Dcomponent=identity
        ```

8. Stop the serevr once the task of migration client is completed.

### Executing the sync tool

!!! warning
    Proceed with this step only if you have opt in for [Zero down time migration](#zero-down-time-migration).
    Otherwise your migration task is completed now and you can omit the following steps.
    
1.  Start the data sync tool with below command pointing to the  sync.properties file. This will start syncing data 
    created in the old WSO2 Identity Server database after taking the database dump to the new WSO2 Identity Server database.
    ```bash
    sh wso2server.sh -DsyncData -DconfigFile=<path to sync.properties file>/sync.properties
    ```

2.  Monitor the logs in the sync tool to see how many entries are synced at a given time and the data sync process is 
    completed. Below line will be printed in the logs for each table you have specified to sync if there are no 
    data to be synced.

    ```tab="Sample"
    [2019-02-27 17:26:32,388]  INFO {org.wso2.is.data.sync.system.pipeline.process.BatchProcessor} -  No data to sync for: <TABLE_NAME>
    ```
    
    !!! info
        If you have some traffic to the old version of the WSO2 Identity Server, the number of entries to be synced might 
        not become zero at any time. In that case, watch for the logs and decide on a point that the number of entries 
        that are synced is a lower value.

3.  When the data sync is completed, switch the traffic from the old setup to the new setup.

4.  Allow the sync client to run for some time to sync the entries that were not synced before switching the deployments. 
    When the number of entries synced by the sync tool, becomes zero, stop the sync client.
    
### Verifying the migration was successful

After the migration is completed do the following verification steps.

+   Monitor the system health (CPU, memory usage etc).
+   Monitor the WSO2 logs to see if there are errors logged in the log files.
+   Run functional tests against the migrated deployment to verify that all functionality is working as expected.

If you see any problems in the migrated system, revert the traffic back to the previous setup and investigate the problem.
