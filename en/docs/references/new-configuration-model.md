# New Configuration Model

Previous WSO2 Identity Server versions supported multiple configuration files such as <code>carbon.xml</code>, <code>identity.xml</code>, and <code>axis2.xml</code>. With the new configuration model in WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0, configurations are handled by the <code>deployment.toml</code> file in the <code><IS_HOME>/repository/conf/</code> directory. 

For TOML configurations pertaining to a particular feature, see the respective document section.
