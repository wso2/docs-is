# About this Release

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) 6.1.0 is the latest WSO2 IS release and is the successor of version 6.0.0. WSO2 IS 6.1.0 includes several improvements and new features to strengthen the offerings of the WSO2 IS 6.x.x series.

## What's new in WSO2 IS 6.x.x?

The following new features and enhancements (introduced in WSO2 IS 6.0.0) are included in WSO2 IS 6.1.0.

-   **Integration with TypingDNA**

    TypingDNA is a behavioral biometrics vendor and a pioneer in delivering typing biometrics technology as an API for user-friendly authentication to businesses across cybersecurity, finance, education, and retail. The vendor leverages typing biometrics to provide customers with a seamless, user-friendly, risk-based authentication (RBA) experience to enhance security and fraud detection.

-   **Integration with ELK for identity analytics** 

    Easy integration with ELK to view login and session-related analytics data.

-   **Multi-attribute login support** 

    This simplifies user sign-in by allowing users to sign in with their preferred attributes, such as email, phone number, or username, as the login identifier.

-   **Device flow support** 

    This expands the range of devices an organization can use within their overall solution by including devices with limited user input capabilities (such as smart TVs, which do not have keyboards). With device flow support, users can leverage other devices, such as smartphones, to complete login on a device with limited input.

-   **PBKDF2 hashing for user passwords**

    This is a simple cryptographic key derivation function, which is resistant to brute force attacks. PBKDF2 is recommended by NIST, and PBKDF2 is required to achieve FIPS-140 compliance.

-   **Java 17 Runtime compatibility**

    Java 17 is the latest LTS release of Java. Premier support of Java 11 is supposed to end in September 2023. WSO2 Identity Server 6.0.0 distribution is compatible with Java 17 runtime.

-   **Authentication SDKs**

    SDKs allow you to integrate web or single-page applications easily with WSO2 Identity Server and OpenID Connect while adhering to security best practices. The following SDKs are supported:

    - [React SDK]({{base_path}}/sdks/start-integrating-apps/integrate-a-react-app/)
    - [Angular SDK]({{base_path}}/sdks/start-integrating-apps/integrate-an-angular-app/)
    - [JavaScript SDK]({{base_path}}/sdks/start-integrating-apps/integrate-a-js-app/)

-   **Passwordless authentication with Magic Link**

    Magic Link is a form of passwordless authentication. It allows users to log in by clicking a link sent to their email instead of entering a password.

-   **FIDO attestation validations**

    FIDO attestation validations allow you to further validate the FIDO2 authenticator data during the security key registration.

-   **Federated IDP Initiated OIDC Back-Channel Logout**

    With OIDC identity federation in the identity server, WSO2 IS acts as a Relying Party (RP) to the federated identity provider. However, currently, there is no mechanism to terminate the sessions and revoke tokens in WSO2 IS (RP) whenever there is a session update on the federated IDP (OP) side. 
    
    The OIDC Back Channel Logout v1.0 spec defines a mechanism for communicating logout requests to all RPs that have established sessions with an OP. This mechanism relies upon direct communication of such requests between OP and RPs bypassing the User-Agent. It imposes new requirements that RPs have a logout endpoint that is reachable by the OP. This feature will enable that capability in WSO2 Identity Server.

-   **Support for rotating symmetric encryption key**

    This is an external tool that re-encrypts internal data after rotation of the configured symmetric data encryption key. You can use this tool to re-encrypt the identity and registry databases and other configuration files as user store configurations. Additionally, the tool can sync end-user data that gets generated in the live system with minimum downtime.

-   **Remove the dependency on cookies for OIDC flows when extending the IdP session**

    This is a solution to overcome the restrictions (due to third-party cookie limitations by browsers such as Safari) to extend IDP sessions when application and IDP origins differ from each other. This serves as an alternative to passive authentication requests that would no longer work in impacted browsers.

    [Learn more]({{base_path}}/apis/idp-session-extender-endpoint/)
    
-   **Auto login after self-registration**

    In the self-registration flow, the user is asked to re-enter password credentials after the user is verified using email. With this feature, after the user is verified by clicking the verification mail, the user is logged in immediately without having to re-enter credentials.

    [Learn more]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-lifecycles/self-registration-workflow/)

-   **Enhanced login portal and my account**

    Hides UI widgets based on tenant-level account management configuration preferences such as self-registration and account recovery. This dynamically changes the UI elements according to the tenant-level configurations. For example, if self-registration is not enabled for the tenant, the self-registration link is hidden on the login page.

-   **reCAPTCHA v3 and invisible reCAPTCHA v2 support**

    Improved security against spam and fraudulent activity with an enhanced reCAPTCHA user experience compared to the conventional "I'm not a robot" checkbox.

    [Learn more]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure-recaptcha/)

-  **Tenant qualified URLs and tenanted sessions**

    From IS 7.0.0 onwards, tenant qualified URLs will be enabled by default, which consistently qualifies every URL/ endpoint of WSO2 Identity Server with the tenant in a path parameter. This improves flexibility for tenant-wise sharding and branding compared to previous releases.

    Additionally from IS 7.0.0 onwards, tenanted sessions will also be enabled allowing sessions and caches to be created in a tenanted space.

-   **OAuth client ID tenant unification**

    OAuth consumer application client IDs are now tenant unique allowing same client ID to exist in multiple tenants. This feature requires tenant qualified URLs and tenanted sessions.

    !!! info
        Once you start the identity server with tenant qualified URLs and tenanted sessions being enabled, you cannot disable them back as it could led to inconsistencies with this feature.

WSO2 IS 6.1.0 introduces the following new features and enhancements:

-   **Google One Tap authentication** 
    
    Enabling seamless authentication with Google on authenticated Google sessions with a single tap. A personalized login button will be there for sign-in/sign-up. This option is enabled via the existing Google authenticator.

    [Learn more]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-federation/google/)

-   **Accessibility**
    
    The user authentication and recovery pages are now WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, enhancing the accessibility of WSO2 Identity Server to a broader audience.
