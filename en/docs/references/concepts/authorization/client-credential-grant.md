# Client Credential Grant Type

### Recommended Use

This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication or for a client making requests to an API that does not 
require the user’s permission. This grant should be allowed for use only by trusted [confidential clients](client-types.md).

### How does it work ?

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials with this grant type. It is similar to the 
[resource owner password credentials grant type](/references/concepts/authorization/resource-owner-grant) except in this case, only the client’s credentials 
are used to authenticate a request for an access token.

The diagram below illustrates the implicit grant flow.

One of the following cURL commands can be used to try this grant type.

``` java tab="Request 1"
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client id:client secret value>" -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" <token_endpoint>
```

``` java tab="Request 2"
curl -u <client id>:<client secret> -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" <token_endpoint>
```

You will receive a response similiar to the format below.

**Response**

``` java
{"token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":2061,"access_token":"ca19a540f544777860e44e75f605d927"}
```

!!! info "Support for refresh token grant - No"
    This grant type doesn't issue a refresh token which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the [refresh token grant](refresh-token-grant.md)
