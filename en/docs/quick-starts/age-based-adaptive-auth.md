# Configure User Age-Based Adaptive Authentication

This page guides you through configuring user age-based adaptive authentication for a sample web application using sample hardware key and fingerprint authenticators. 

----

## Scenario

The instructions below guide you through specifying authentication steps based on the user's age. In this example, any user who is underage and below the specified age limit (i.e., under the age of 18 years) is restricted access and prevented from logging in to the application.

1.  Create a user called "Alex" with login permission.

    For instructions, see [Adding Users](../../../guides/identity-lifecycles/admin-creation-workflow/) and [Adding Roles](../../../guides/identity-lifecycles/add-user-roles/).

2. Edit Alex's user profile and enter a birth date that specifies Alex as under 18 years of age.  
    For instructions, see [Editing User Profile](../../../guides/identity-lifecycles/update-profile/).

    Enter the birth date in the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`.

3.  Next, create another user called "Kim".

4.  Edit Kim's user profile and enter a birth date that specifies Kim as over 18 years of age.

6.  Click **Ok**. The authentication script and authentication steps
    are configured. 
    
    The authentication script grants access only to users who are 18 years or above and restricts underage users.

7.  Click **Update**.

2.  Click **Login** and enter Kim's credentials. You are successfully
    logged in to the application.  

3.  Logout and login as Alex. Note that you are now restricted from
    logging in because Alex is underage.
