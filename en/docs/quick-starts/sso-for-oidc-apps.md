## Scenario

Pickup is a cab company that has two OIDC web applications called pickup-dispatch and pickup-manager. Both applications use WSO2 Identity Server (IS) as the identity provider. When SSO is configured for both these applications, a user is only required to provide their credentials to the first application and the user will be automatically logged in to the second application.

2. You will be redirected to the login page of WSO2 IS. Log in using your WSO2 IS credentials (admin/admin). Provide the required consent.
You will be redirected to the Pickup Dispatch application home page.

3. Now, if you navigate to `http://wso2is.local:8080/pickup-manager` and click **Login**, you can see that user has been automatically logged in to this application without being prompted for user credentials.

You have successfully configured OpenID Connect single sign-on for two web applications using WSO2 IS as the identity provider.
