# Configure Limiting Active User Sessions 

This page guides you through setting up active user session limiting for a sample application based on a particular criteria, using sample authenticators.

----

## Scenario

Consider a scenario where you want a user who has an administrator role that cannot have more than one active concurrent session at a time. If there are one or more active user sessions, you can either terminate a session or deny authentication for a user.

## Configure concurrent-session-based authentication

1.  Click **Service Providers > List**.

2.  Click **Edit** on the `saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com` service provider.

3.  Expand the **Local and Outbound Configuration** section and click **Advanced Authentication**.

4.  Expand **Script Based Conditional Authentication**.

5.  Click **Templates** on the right side of the **Script Based Conditional Authentication** field and then click **Concurrent-Session-Management**.

7.  Click **Ok**. The authentication script and authentication steps
    are configured. 
    
    The authentication script defines a conditional step that executes session handling prompt only if the user belongs to an 'admin' or 'manager' role.  Here you can specify the value of `MaxSessionCount` variable to indicate the maximum number of sessions allowed. The default value is 1. For the purpose of this demo, change the value to 3.

    !!! note
        You can configure the `MaxSessionCount` variable via the `deployment.toml` file in the  `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/` directory as well. Priority will be given to the configuration in the adaptive authentication script. To configure the `MaxSessionCount` variable through the `deployment.toml` file, append the following configuration with the intended value for `MaxSessionCount`. 

        ```
        authentication.authenticator.session_handler.parameters.max_session_count = “3”
        ```

6.  Click **Add Authentication Step**.

4.  Now you can either terminate one or more active sessions or deny the login. 

    !!! tip 
        -   If you select and terminate the active sessions exceeding the maximum limit, you will be navigated to the application home page. Otherwise you will be re-prompted until the minimum required number of sessions are terminated. 
        -   You can use the **Refresh Sessions** button to re-check active user sessions.

5.  If you deny the login, the Authentication Error screen appears.
