{! fragments/travelocity.md !}

### Add custom attribute dialects

{! fragments/add-custom-attributes-saml.md !}

### Set mandatory attributes

{! fragments/set-mandatory-attributes.md !}

### Set role attribute URI

{! fragments/set-role-attribute.md !}

1.  Select **Update**. 

### Try it out 

1.  Log in to the sample application at <http://wso2is.local:8080/travelocity.com/index.jsp> using admin credentials. 

    !!! info

3. You are now successfully logged in to the sample application. 

4.  In the landing page of the application, you can see that the values of application attributes that were mapped to the local attributes instead of the local attributes. The application attribute, `Name` contains the value of the application role instead of the username since it was configured as the `role attribute URI`.
