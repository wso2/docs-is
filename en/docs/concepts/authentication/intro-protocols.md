# Introduction to Authentication Protocols

### What is an Authentication Protocol?
A protocol is a set of pre-defined rules used when two or more parties communicate with each other. An authentication protocol
is a type of computer communications protocol that is designed to transfer authentication data between two or more entities.

### Password authentication protocol
This is one of the oldest protocols used for authentication. When
using this protocol, authentication happens using the typical **username
and password** approach. Although this approach is simple to use and
deploy, it has some security considerations. If a malicious user is able
to guess or obtain the password of a legitimate user, he/she will be able to 
access the system.

As a solution for the security issues raised for the typical password authentication protocol, advanced authentication protocols came into play in order to securely transmit authentication data between entities.
