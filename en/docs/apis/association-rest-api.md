# User Account Associations API Definition

??? Note "Click for instructions"
    Follow the steps given below to try out the REST APIs with your local instance of WSO2 Identity Server. 
    
       1.  Click **Authorize** and provide the desired values for authentication. 
       2.  Expand the relevant API operation and click the **Try It Out** button.  
       3.  Fill in relevant sample values for the input parameters and click **Execute**. 
            You will receive a sample curl command with the sample values you filled in. 
       4. Add a `-k` header to the curl command and run the curl command on the terminal with a running instance of WSO2
         IS. 
         
    #### Before trying out the embedded postman collection with the "Run in Postman" option, make sure the following conditions are met.
    
       1. A user named `john`, with the password `pass123`, exists in the tenant `carbon.super`. For instructions on creating a user, see [here]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-lifecycles/admin-creation-workflow/).
       2. The id value for the local user association `john` is used for some API calls, which is assumed as 
       `UFJJTUFSWS9qb2hu` 
       
        !!! info
            This id value for the local user association is returned when a GET request is made to `/me/associations` or 
            `/{user-id}/association` API, once the association between `john` and `admin` users are created with the POST 
            request to the `/me/associations` API. 
            
       3. An identity provider with the name `ExternalIdP`, exists in the tenant `carbon.super`. For instructions on creating a new identity provider, see [here]({{base_path}}/apis/idp-rest-api).
       4. A federated association with a user in the above identity provider exists for the `admin` user. The id of this 
       association (which is equal to `2e053351-0d69-476e-81df-04a9cfdfb50e` in the provided postman samples) is used 
       for some API calls. This id can be retrieved by making a GET request to the `/me/federated-association` (or 
       `/{user-id}/federated-association`) API.
