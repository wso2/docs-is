### Configuring the Dropbox App

1.  Place the authenticator .jar file into the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins          `
    directory. You can download the
    .jar(org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.dropbox) file from the
    [wso2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list?q=%22_default%22%3A%22dropbox%22)
    .

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade theÂ Dropbox Authenticator (.jar) in your
        existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)
    

2.  Navigate to <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps> and create a
    new app. You must create or have a Dropbox account for this.

3.  Enter the name of your new app and click **Create App**.
4.  Specify the redirect URI as <https://localhost:9443/commonauth> in
    the window that appears.  
5.  Now you have finished configuring Dropbox. Copy the **App key** and
    **App Secret** from the above page.

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to deploy the travelocity.com sample app in order to
use it in this scenario.

To configure this, see [deploying travelocity.com sample
app](_Deploying_the_Sample_App_).

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by [adding a new identity
provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
.

1.  Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/) and [run
    it](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Running+the+Product).
2.  Log in to the [management
    console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console)
    as an administrator.
3.  In the **Identity Providers** section under the **Main** tab of the
    management console, click **Add**.
4.  Give a suitable name for **Identity Provider Name**.
