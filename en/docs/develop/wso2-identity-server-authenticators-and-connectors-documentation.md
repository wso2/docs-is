# WSO2 Identity Server Authenticators and Connectors Documentation

A WSO2 Identity Server **authenticator** allows you to authenticate the user
using third party authentication systems such as LinkedIn, Duo security
and Foursquare. You can [configure the authenticators for your identity
provider](../../tutorials/configuring-federated-authentication)
to reach out to third party authentication systems to authenticate a
user who logs in to your application. For example, if you configure
LinkedIn authenticator as your authenticator in WSO2 Identity Server,
you can authenticate a user of your application using LinkedIn
authentication. You can also do the authentication with multiple third
party authentication systems with a single authentication request.

A **provisioning connector** allows you to provision the users from WSO2
Identity Server to other external systems. If you want to provision a
user to an external identity provider, say for example to Salesforce or
Google Apps, you need to [Configuring Outbound Provisioning Connectors for an Identity Provider](../../using-wso2-identity-server/configuring-outbound-provisioning-connectors-for-an-identity-provider).

To browse the available Identity Server connectors, go to the [WSO2
Store](https://store.wso2.com/store/).
