Each authenticator provides you a way to authenticate the user using
specific external authentication system. For example if you want to
authenticate a user who logs into your application using LinkedIn
authenticator, you need to configure the LinkedIn authenticator for your
identity provider.

Each provisioning connector provides you a way to provision the user to
an external identity provider from WSO2 Identity Server. For example,
you can configure Salesforce connector as provisioning connector for
your identity provider to provision the user to your Salesforce app from
the WSO2 Identity Server.
