# Configuring Wordpress Authenticator

The Wordpress authenticator allows you to authenticate users using
Wordpress through the WSO2 Identity Server. This page provides
instructions on how to configure the Wordpress authenticator and the
WSO2 Identity Server for logging into a sample app.

You can find more information in the following sections.

This is tested for the Wordpress API version 1.0. Wordpress
Authenticator is supported by Identity Server 5.1.0 upwards.

    [wso2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list?q=%22_default%22%3A%22Wordpress%22)
    .

        **Note** : You can either use your Wordpress developer account
        credentials or your own Google account credentials to log in.
