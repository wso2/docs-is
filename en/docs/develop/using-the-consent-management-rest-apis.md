# Using the Consent Management REST APIs

The consent management APIs in WSO2 Identity Server collect and manage
end user consents when user information is shared with external parties.
The following sections guide you through the consent management concepts
and the APIs you can invoke.

### Definitions for consent management

This section defines and explains commonly used terms in consent
management.

-   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Any information that can be used to identify the PII Principal to whom the information relates to.
-   **PII Principal**: The natural person to whom the personally identifiable information (PII) relates to.
-   **Consent**: A Personally identifiable information (PII) Principal’s freely
    given, specific and informed agreement to the processing of their
    PII.
-   **Purpose**: The business, operational or regulatory requirement for the
    collection, use and/or disclosure of a PII Principal's data. In
    other words, it is the reason personal information is collected by
    the entity.
-   **Consent Receipt**: A record of a consent interaction (or consent record summary
    linked to the record of consent) provided by a PII Principal to a
    PII Controller to collect, use and disclose the PII Principal’s PII
    in accordance to an agreed set of terms.
-   **PII Controller**: A private stakeholder that determines the purposes and means for
    processing personally identifiable information (PII) other than the
    natural persons who use data for personal purposes.  
Add the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

    For information on the REST APIs, supported operations and sample requests/responses, see [Consent Management APIs Swagger Documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS590/apidocs/Consent-management-apis/).
    

### Extension points

You can customize the REST APIs using the following extension points:

-   [PIIController connector extension](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/tree/product-is3289/consent-mgt/piicontroller/org.wso2.carbon.identity.piicontroller) -
    A sample implementation that demonstrates registering a PII
    controller and providing PII controller information for consent
    receipts.  
-   [Interceptor extension](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/tree/product-is3289/consent-mgt/interceptor) -
    A sample implementation that demonstrates registering a consent
    management interceptor and intercepting consent management related
    operations.
