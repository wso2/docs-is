# Twitter Authenticator

The Twitter authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator in
WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate Twitter users to log in to your
organization’s applications. Twitter is a free social networking
microblogging service that allows registered members to broadcast short
posts called tweets.

The diagram below illustrates the flow of the Twitter federated
authenticator.
