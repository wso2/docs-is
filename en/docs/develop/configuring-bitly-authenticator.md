### Deploying Bitly artifacts

-   Download the Bitly Authenticator and artifcats from [the WSO2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/details/83ec7d04-46f1-426a-b4cb-1a169846212c)
    .

-   Place the
    `           org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.bitly.connector-x.x.x.jar          `
    file into the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins          `
    directory.

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade the Bitly Authenticator (.jar) in your
        existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)
    

### Configuring the Bitly App

1.  Create a bitly account using the URL " <https://bitly.com/a/sign_up>
    ".
2.  Register your app at <https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps> .  
    ![](attachments/50518515/51251641.png) 
3.  Use <https://localhost:9443/commonauth> as the authorization
    callback URL when you register the client.
4.  Now you can get the clientId and clientSecret of your created app.

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to [deploy the sample app](_Deploying_the_Sample_App_)
in order to use it in this scenario.

Once this is done, the next step is to configure the WSO2 Identity
Server by adding an [identity
provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
and [service provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510).

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by [adding a new identity
provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
.

1.  Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/).

2.  Run the [WSO2 Identity
    Server](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Running+the+Product).
3.  Log in to the [management
    console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console)
    as an administrator.
4.  In the **Identity Providers** section under the **Main** tab of the
    management console, click **Add**.
5.  Give a suitable name for **Identity Provider Name**.  
    ![](attachments/50518515/51251655.png) 
6.  Navigate to **Bitly Configuration** under **Federated
    Authenticators**.

7.  Enter the values as given in the above figure.

    | Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sample Value                             |
    |---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | Enable        | Selecting this option enables Bitly to be used as an authenticator for users provisioned to the Identity Server.                                                                               | Selected                                 |
    | Default       | Selecting the **Default** checkbox signifies that Bitly is the main/default form of authentication. This removes the selection made for any other Default checkboxes for other authenticators. | Selected                                 |
    | Client Id     | This is the client ID received from the Bitly application.                                                                                                                                     | 3889862b0a9517bf2bcb2eed8d43f0be0576e735 |
    | Client Secret | This is the client secret received from the Bitly application. Click the **Show** button to view the value you enter.                                                                          | f841934f19cc59d1914f0865f3694b453b5fe583 |
    | Callback URL  | This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected after the authentication is successful. It should have this format: https://(host-name):(port)/acs .                                 | https://localhost:9443/commonauth        |

8.  Select both checkboxes to **Enable** the Bitly authenticator and
    make it the **Default** authenticator.

9.  Click **Register**.

You have now added the identity provider.

### Configuring the service provider

The next step is to configure the service provider.

1.  Return to the management console.

2.  In the **Service Providers** section, click **Add** under the
    **Main** tab.

3.  Since you are using travelocity as the sample, enter
    `           travelocity.com          ` in the **Service Provider
    Name** text box and click **Register**.

4.  In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.

5.  Now set the configuration as follows:

    1.  **Issuer** : travelocity.com

    2.  **Assertion Consumer URL** :
        <http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp>

    under **Federated Authentication**.
