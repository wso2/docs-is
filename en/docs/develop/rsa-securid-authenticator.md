# RSA SecurID Authenticator

The RSA SecurID authenticator allows you to authenticate users using RSA
SecurID through WSO2 Identity Server. RSA SecurID is a two-factor
authentication mechanism is based on the time and self-generated tokens.
This allows the user to log into a system with software tokens and
hardware tokens like keyfobs. The authentication codes at fixed interval
using a built-in clock and the cardâ€™s factory-encoded random key.

### Getting started

To get started with the authenticator, see [Configuring RSA SecurID
Authenticator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Configuring+RSA+SecurID+Authenticator)
for information and configuration steps. Once you have completed your
configurations, you can authenticate users using the RSA SecurID
authenticator.
