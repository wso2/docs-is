# Configuring Github Authenticator

!!! warning
    For latest instructions on how to configuring the Github authenticator,
    see Github Authenticator [Github
    repository](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-outbound-auth-github/tree/master/docs).
    
The Github authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator in
WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate Github users to log in to your
organization’s applications. Github is a web-based hosting service for
software development projects that facilitates powerful collaboration,
code review, and code management for open source and private software
development projects.

This page provides instructions on how to configure the Github
authenticator and Identity Server using a sample app. You can find more
information in the following sections.

!!! info 
        To download the authenticator and other artifacts, go to [IS Connector
        Store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/details/bfed96a9-0d79-4770-9c55-22378d3a2812).

!!! info 
    Github Authenticator  is supported by Identity Server 5.1.0 upwards.

### Deploying Github artifacts

-   Download the artifacts for this authenticator from [the
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/details/bfed96a9-0d79-4770-9c55-22378d3a2812)
    .

-   Place the org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.github-1.0.0.jar
    file into the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins          `
    directory.

    !!! note
        If you want to upgrade the Github Authenticator (.jar) in your
        existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](../../develop/upgrading-an-authenticator)
    

### Configuring the Github App

1.  Go to <https://www.github.com/>, and create a github account.
2.  Register your app at <https://github.com/settings/applications/new>
    .  
    ![](../../assets/img/49774670/49971235.png) 

3.  Use `          https://localhost:9443/commonauth         ` as the
    authorization callback URL when you register the client.

4.  Now you can get the clientId and clientSecret of your created app.

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to [deploy the sample app](../../develop/deploying-the-sample-app)
in order to use it in this scenario.

Once this is done, the next step is to configure the WSO2 Identity
Server by adding an [identity
provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider)
and [service
provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-a-service-provider)
.

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by [adding a new identity
provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider)
.

1.  Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/).

2.  Run the [WSO2 Identity
    Server](../../setup/running-the-product).
3.  Log in to the [management
    console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console)
    as an administrator.
4.  In the **Identity Providers** section under the **Main** tab of the
    management console, click **Add**.
5.  Give a suitable name for **Identity Provider Name**.  
    ![](../../assets/img/49774670/49971239.png) 
6.  Navigate to **Github Configuration** under **Federated
    Authenticators**.

7.  Enter the values as given in the above figure.

    -   **Client Id** : Client Id for your app.
    -   **Client Secret** : Client Secret for your app.
    -   **Scope** : Scope of the authorize token. For information on
        available scopes, see
        [Scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps/)
        .
    -   **Callback URL** : Service Provider's URL where code needs to be
        sent .

8.  Select both checkboxes to **Enable** the Github authenticator and
    make it the **Default**.

        <td><div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected after the authentication is successful. The URL should be specified in the following format:<br />
        <code>                   https://&lt;HOST_NAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/acs                  </code></p>
        </div></td>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

    in the **Service Provider Name** text box and click **Register**.

4.  In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.
