# Configuring X509Certificate Authenticator

This page provides instructions on how to configure the X509 certificate
authenticator and the WSO2 Identity Server using a sample app to
demonstrate authentication. You can find more information in the
following sections.

X509Certificate Authenticator is supported by WSO2 Identity Server
versions 5.1.0, 5.2.0, 5.3.0, 5.4.0, 5.4.1 and 5.5.0

### Working with certificates

X509 authentication requires the client to posses a Public Key
Certificate (PKC).

What is a Public Key Certificate (PKC) and Certificate Authority (CA)?

Public key cryptography relies on a public and private key pair to
encrypt and decrypt content. The keys are mathematically related, and
content encrypted by using one of the keys can only be decrypted by
using the other. The private key is kept secret. The public key is
typically embedded in a binary certificate, and the certificate is
published to a database that can be reached by all authorized users. The
certificate binds the public key to an entity and is used to protect
information, encrypt transactions, and ensure secure communication.

Certificate Authorities, or Certificate Authorities / CAs, issue Digital
Certificates. Digital Certificates are verifiable small data files that
contain identity credentials to help websites, people, and devices
represent their authentic online identity (authentic because the CA has
verified the identity)

If **X509 authentication** is specified, the WSO2 IS will authenticate
the client using the client’s public key certificate. To issue the
digital certificate, a Certificate Authority (CA) is required. A CA
issues digital certificates that contain identity credentials in order
to help websites, people and devices represent their authentic,
CA-verified, online identity.

To create a sample certificate and create your own Certificate Authority
to sign the certificates, follow the following steps:

1.  The first step is to create the private RSA key:

    ``` xml
    openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
    ```

    Here, the specified key size is 2048 bit. You can specify the key
    size for your private key.

2.  Based on this key you can now generate an actual certificate which
    is valid for 10 years using the following command:

    ``` xml
        openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt 
    ```

    You are prompted to provide the following details, and the details
    you provide are incorporated to the certificate request.  
    Example: Make sure you use the values that fit your use case.

    ``` java
        Country Name (2 letter code) [AU] : SL 
        State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Western 
        Locality Name (eg, city) [ ]:Colombo 
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:WSO2 
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [ ]:QA 
        Common Name (e.g. serverFQDN or YOUR name) [ ]: wso2is.com  
        Email Address [ ]:maneesha@wso2.com 
    ```

3.  An OpenSSL CA requires new files and supporting directories.
    Therefore, create a new directory.  
    Create the directory structure according to your
    `           openssl.conf          ` format.

    ``` xml
        mkdir -p demoCA/newcerts
    ```

4.  You also need some initial files inside your CA directory structure.

    ``` xml
        touch demoCA/index.txt
        echo '01' > demoCA/serial
    ```

5.  In order for the JVM to trust your newly created certificate import
    your certificate into your JVM trust store by executing the
    following command:

    ``` xml
        keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -keystore ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
    ```

    !!! note
    
        Got the permission denied error?
    
        Note that when adding the certificate to the JVM trust store you may
        get the permission denied error. Running this command as an
        administrator resolves this permission issue.  
        For example, if you are a Mac users, you can use
        `           sudo          ` in front of this command to fix the
        permission issue.
    

6.  Now you have created the CA to sign the certificate. To create the
    server certificate follow the steps given below:
    1.  Create the keystore that includes the private key by executing
        the following command:

        ``` xml
        keytool -genkey -v -alias localcrt -keyalg RSA -validity 3650 -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -keypass localpwd
        ```

        You are prompted for details after executing the above command.
        For "What is your first and last name?" you need to give a name
        without space(e.g.,: wso2). This name is the CN to [create a
        user](#ConfiguringX509CertificateAuthenticator-createauser).

        This command will create a keystore with the following details:

        -   Keystore name: localcrt.jks

        -   Alias of public certificate: localcrt

        -   Keystore password: localpwd

        -   Private key password: localpwd (this is required to be the
            same as keystore password)

    2.  Execute the following command to generate the certificate
        signing request(CSR) using the generated keystore file.

        ``` xml
                keytool -certreq -alias localcrt -file localcrt.csr -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd
        ```

    3.  To enable CRL or OCSP based certificate revocation validation,
        configure the necessary openSSL extension configurations.

        1.  Open either of the following files.
            1.  `                validation.cnf               `
            2.  `                /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf               `
        2.  Set the following properties under x509\_extensions.

            ``` java
                        crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://pki.google.com/GIAG2.crl
                        authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI: http://clients1.google.com/ocsp
            ```

    4.  Once it is done you need to sign the CSR, which requires the CA
        root key.

        ``` xml
                openssl ca -batch -startdate 150813080000Z -enddate 250813090000Z -keyfile rootCA.key -cert rootCA.crt -policy policy_anything -out localcrt.crt -infiles localcrt.csr
        ```

        This creates a signed certificate called
        `             localcrt.crt            ` that is valid for
        a specified time period that is denoted by the
        `             startdate            ` and
        `             enddate            ` .

    5.  The next step is to import the CA and signed certificate into
        the keystore.

        ``` xml
                keytool -importcert -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -noprompt
        
                keytool -importcert -alias localcrt -file demoCA/newcerts/01.pem -keystore localcrt.jks -storepass localpwd -noprompt
        ```

    6.  Now, get the `             pkcs12            ` out of
        `             .crt            ` file using the command given
        below as it is been used to import certificates to the browser.

        ``` xml
                keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore localcrt.jks -destkeystore localhost.p12 -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass localpwd -deststorepass browserpwd -srcalias localcrt -destalias browserKey -srckeypass localpwd -destkeypass browserpwd -noprompt
        ```

        Make sure to use the same password you used when creating the
        keystore for the `             srcstorepass            ` in the
        above step. Now you have the
        `                           localhost.p12                         `
        file that you can import into your browser as explained in the
        [import
        certificate](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Configuring+X509Certificate+Authenticator#ConfiguringX509CertificateAuthenticator-Importcertificate)
        section.

7.  Next, create a new trust store and import the server certificate
    into the trust store using the following commands:

    ``` xml
        keytool -import -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass cacertspassword -alias rootCA -file rootCA.crt -noprompt
        keytool -importcert -alias localcrt -file localcrt.crt -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass cacertspassword -noprompt
    ```

    CN

    The User objects in the LDAP directory hierarchy have designators
    that start with CN, meaning Common Name. The CN designator applies
    to all but a few object types. Active Directory only uses two other
    object designators (although LDAP defines several).

Once you have done the above steps, you have the keystore (
`         localcrt.jks        ` ), truststore (
`         cacerts.jks        ` ), and pkcs12 (
`         localhost.p12        ` ) files that you need to use later on
in this guide.

### Configuring the X509 Certificate for the app

1.  Download the [WSO2 Identity
    Server](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/).

2.  Replace your keystore file path, keystore password, trust store file
    path and trust store password (you can use the keystore and
    truststore, which you created under the [Working with
    Certificate](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Configuring+X509Certificate+Authenticator#ConfiguringX509CertificateAuthenticator-Workingwithcertificate)
    section) in the following configuration and add it to
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml          `
    file.

    ``` xml
        <Connector
                protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                port="8443" maxThreads="200"
                scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
                keystoreFile="/path/to/keystore.jks" keystorePass="keystorepwd"
                truststoreFile="/path/to/truststore.jks" truststorePass="truststorespassword"
                clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS"/>
    ```

    !!! note
    
        -   In order to function properly, this connector should come first
            in the order. Otherwise, when mutual SSL takes place, the
            already existing connector (9443) will be picked up and the
            certificate will not be retrieved correctly.
        -   The `            clientAuth           ` attribute causes the
            Tomcat to require the client with providing a certificate that
            can be configured as follows.
            -   `               true              ` : valid client
                certificate required for a connection to succeed
    
            -   `               want              ` : use a certificate if
                available, but still connect if no certificate is available
    
            -   `               false              ` : no client certificate
                is required or validated
    
        <!-- -->
    
        -   The `            truststoreFile           ` attributes specifies
            the location of the truststore that contains the trusted
            certificate issuers.
    

3.  Download the authenticator .jar file and the artifacts from the
    [WSO2
    store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list?q=%22_default%22%3A%22X509%22)
    .

4.  Place the `           authenticator          `
    `           .jar          ` file in the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins          `
    directory.

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade the X509 Certificate Authenticator in your
        existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)
    

5.  Place the
    `           x509certificateauthenticationendpoint.war          `
    file in the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps          `
    directory.

### **Disabling Certificate Validation**

!!! warning
    
    In product versions prior to WSO2 Identity Server 5.7.0, the
    CRL-and-OCSP-based certificate validations were disabled by default.
    With WSO2 Identity Server 5.7.0, CAs could be added to a truststore and
    get them verified through certificate validation. To complement this,
    CRL-and-OCSP-based certificate validations were enabled by default.
    Enabling certificate validation without adding the CAs to the truststore
    may cause errors.
    
    Disable certificate validation if you are using WSO2 Identity Server
    5.7.0 and do not require verifying CAs through certificate validation.
    

The location that is used to disable certificate validation depends on
whether WSO2 Identity Server was started at least once or not.

-   If you have never started WSO2 Identity Server before, the
    configurations should be made on the
    `          certificate-validation.xml         ` file.
-   If you have started WSO2 Identity Server at leasts once, the
    configurations should be made on the registry parameters.

#### Disabling Certificate Validation in an Unstarted WSO2 IS Pack

Follow the steps below to disable certificate validation if WSO2
Identity Server was never started.

1.  Open the `          certificate-validation.xml         ` file in the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/security         ` repository.
2.  Disable certificate validation.

    1.  To disable CRL-based certificate validation, set the
        `            enable           ` sub-parameter of the
        `            org.wso2.carbon.identity.x509Certificate.validation.validator.CRLValidator           `
        validator, to `            false           ` .
    2.  To disable OCSP-based certificate validation, set the
        `            enable           ` sub-parameter of the
        `            org.wso2.carbon.identity.x509Certificate.validation.validator.OCSPValidato           `
        validator, to `            false           ` .

    Example:

    ``` java
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <CertificateValidation xmlns="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon/certificate-validation.xml">
     <Validators>
     <Validator name="org.wso2.carbon.identity.x509Certificate.validation.validator.CRLValidator" displayName="CRLValidator" enable="false">
                     <Parameter name="priority">1</Parameter>
                     <Parameter name="fullChainValidation">true</Parameter>
                     <Parameter name="retryCount">2</Parameter>
        </Validator>
        <Validator name="org.wso2.carbon.identity.x509Certificate.validation.validator.OCSPValidator" displayName="OCSPValidator" enable="false">
                     <Parameter name="priority">2</Parameter>
                     <Parameter name="fullChainValidation">true</Parameter>
                     <Parameter name="retryCount">1</Parameter>
        </Validator>
    </Validators>
    </CertificateValidation>
    ```

#### Disabling Certificate Validation in an Already-started WSO2 IS Pack

Follow the steps below to disable certificate validation if WSO2
Identity Server was started before.

1.  Access the WSO2 Identity Server Management Console.
2.  Click **Main \> Registry \> Browse**.  
    ![](attachments/50501577/112378780.png) 
3.  Disable CRL certificate validation.
    1.  Locate the CRL parameter by entering
        `            _system/governance/repository/security/certificate/validator/crlvalidator           `
        in the **Location** search box .  
        ![](attachments/50501577/112378782.png) 
    2.  Expand **Properties**.  
        ![](attachments/50501577/112378786.png) 
    3.  Click **Edit** pertaining to the **Enable** property.  
        **![](attachments/50501577/112378794.png)   
        **
    4.  Change the value to `            false           ` and click
        **Save**.  
        ![](attachments/50501577/112378795.png) 
4.  Similarly, disable OCSP certificate validation in the
    `          _system/governance/repository/security/certificate/validator/ocspvalidator         `
    registry parameter.

For more information on CRL and OCSP certificate validation, see
[Configuring Certificate Revocation
Validation](_Configuring_Certificate_Revocation_Validation_).

### **Configuring the Authentication Endpoint**

1.  Open the `          application-authentication.xml         ` file in
    the `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity         `
    directory.
2.  Add the following AuthenticatorConfig configuration to the file.

    1.  `            AuthenticationEndpoint           ` : This is the
        URL with the port that is secured with the certificate, e.g.,
        `                         https://localhost:8443/x509-certificate-servlet                       `
        . Update this based on your host name.
    2.  `            username           ` : This attribute value will be
        taken as the authenticated user subject identifier. Update this
        with any of the certificate attributes, e.g., CN and Email.

    ``` java
        <AuthenticatorConfig name="x509CertificateAuthenticator" enabled="true">
                <Parameter name="AuthenticationEndpoint">https://localhost:8443/x509-certificate-servlet</Parameter>
                <Parameter name="username">CN</Parameter>
        </AuthenticatorConfig>
    ```

    !!! note
    
        When X509 authentication is configured as the second authentication
        step, the certificate will be validated to check whether it is
        associated with the authenticated user in first authentication step.
        For that, the `           username          ` parameter will be
        used. For that, the authenticated user name considered in the first
        authentication step will be validated with the certificate attribute
        in this property.
    
        When X509 authentication is configured as the first step, this
        certificate attribute will be treated as the authenticated user
        subject identifier.
    

3.  If you are using the identity claim dialect URI to store X509
    certificate, add the following parameter.

    ``` java
    <Parameter name="setClaimURI">http://wso2.org/claims/identity/userCertificate</Parameter>
    ```

4.  To enable storing the X509 certificate as a user claim, add the
    following parameter.

    ``` java
        <Parameter name="EnforceSelfRegistration">true</Parameter
    ```

### Adding a claim mapping for the certificate

If storing the certificate as a user claim is enabled, the X509
certificate will be stored as a user claim and verified with the
retrieved certificate from the request.

1.  Sign in to the WSO2 IS Management Console with one of the following
    URLs using `           admin          ` as the **username** and
    **password**.

    ``` java
        For HTTP  --> http://<HTTP_HOST>:9776/carbon
        For HTTPS --> https://<HTTPS_HOST>:9443/carbon
    ```

2.  On the **Main** tab, click **Claims \> Add**.  
    ![](attachments/50501577/103328153.png) 
3.  Click **Add Local Claim**.  
    ![](attachments/50501577/103328154.png) 
4.  Add a new claim for the **certificate** by giving the details as
    below, e.g., select a mapped attribute for the claim that is
    supported by the underlying database type.
    ![](attachments/50501577/103328155.png) 
5.  Click **Add**.

If you are using an identity claim to store X509 Certificates, e.g.,
`                   http://wso2.org/claims/identity                 ,        `
or if you are working with a read only user store, the certificate gets
stored in the `         DATA_VALUE        ` column of the
`         IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA        ` table. The default DB script
sets the column size to 255 characters but in this case the certificate
value has more than 255 characters. Therefore, you need to update the
column size to a higher value.

Follow the steps given below to update the column size:

You do not need to update the column size if you are using WSO2 IS 5.4.0
or above 5.4.0.

-   Refer this
    [link](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Browsing+the+H2+Database)
    to browse the H2 database of WSO2 products, and execute the query
    given below to alter the column size of the H2 database.

    ``` java
        ALTER TABLE IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA ALTER DATA_VALUE VARCHAR(2048);
    ```

-   Refer the table given below to find out the queries you can use for
    the databases listed below:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Database</th>
    <th>Query to alter the column</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>MySQL</td>
    <td><code>               ALTER TABLE IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA CHANGE DATA_VALUE DECIMAL VARCHAR(2048)              </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Oracle</td>
    <td><code>               IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA modify (DATA_VALUE varchar(2048));              </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>MSSQL</td>
    <td><code>               ALTER TABLE IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA              </code><br />
    <code>               ALTER COLUMN DATA_VALUE VARCHAR(2048) NOT NULL;              </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>PostgreSQL</td>
    <td><code>               ALTER TABLE IDN_IDENTITY_USER_DATA ALTER COLUMN DATA_VALUE TYPE VARCHAR(2048); Configuring the X509 Certificate for the app              </code></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

#### Using a wso2 claim for the X509 certificate

If you use are using a wso2 claim to store X509 Certificate, e.g.,
`                   http://wso2.org/claims                 `, the
certificate gets stored as a user attribute in the
`         UM_ATTR_VALUE        ` column of the
`         UM_USER_ATTRIBUTE        ` table. The default DB script sets
the column size to 1024 characters but in this case the certificate
value is having more than 1024 characters Therefore, you need to update
the column size to a higher value.

Follow the steps given below to update the column size:

You do not need to update the column size if you are using WSO2 IS 5.4.0
or above 5.4.0.

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to deploy the travelocity.com sample app in order to
use it in this scenario.

See the topic on [deploying the travelocity.com sample
app](_Deploying_the_Sample_App_) for information on how to configure
this.

### Configuring the service provider

The next step is to configure the service provider.

1.  Return to the management console.
2.  In the **Service Providers** section under the **Main** tab, click
    **Add**.
3.  Since you are using Travelocity as the sample, enter travelocity.com
    in the **Service Provider Name** text box and click **Register**.
4.  In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.
5.  Now set the configuration as follows:  
    1.  **Issuer** : travelocity.com
    2.  **Assertion Consumer URL** :
        http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp
6.  Select the following check-boxes:
    1.  **Enable Response Signing**.
    2.  **Enable Single Logout**.
    3.  **Enable Attribute Profile**.
    4.  **Include Attributes in the Response Always**.

7.  Click **Update** to save the changes. Now you will be sent back to
    the **Service Providers** page.
8.  Go to the **Local and Outbound Authentication Configuration**
    section.
9.  You have two options here. You can add X509 certificate
    authenticator as the first factor and also as the second factor.
    1.  Second factor  
        1.  Select the **Advanced** configuration radio button option.

        2.  Add the **basic** authentication as a first step and
            **X509Certificate** authentication as the second step.  
            ![](attachments/50501577/56985064.png)

    2.  First factor
        -   Select **Local Authentication** as the **Authentication
            Type** and select **X509Certificate** from the drop-down
            list.  
            ![](attachments/50501577/56985065.png) 
        -   When using X509 as first step authentication, you need to
            create a user in IS management console with the Email
            provided while creating the browser certificate.  
            Example:  
            ![](attachments/50501577/72423358.png){height="250"}

            !!! note
            
                        For more information on creating users and assigning roles
                        using management console, refer
                        [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Configuring+Users#ConfiguringUsers-Addinganewuserandassigningroles)
                        .
            
10. Finally, click on **Update** to finish the service provider
    configurations.

You have now added and configured the service provider.

### Configuring CRL Caching

CA provides a CRL that is valid for a limited duration, which is defined
in the **Next Update** CRL field. This field indicates the date by which
the next CRL will be issued. According to the [Internet X.509 PKI
Certificate and CRL Profile](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280), the
next CRL could be issued before but not later than the indicated date.
This property is considered to validate the returned CRL from cache as a
certificate in the CRL can be temporarily invalidated (Hold) rather than
being irreversibly revoked, i.e., an outdated CRL creates a security
exposure.

The X509CRL is downloaded from the CRL URL and persisted in cache.
Follow the steps below to configure CRL caching.

1.  Open the identity.xml located in the
    `          <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity         ` directory.
2.  Locate the `          <CacheManger>         ` element.
3.  Enable CRL caching by using the following snippet.

    ``` java
    <Cache name="CRLCache" enable="false"  timeout="900" capacity="5000" isDistributed="false"/>
    ```
