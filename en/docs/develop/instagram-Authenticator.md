# Instagram Authenticator

The Instagram authenticator allows users to log in to your
organization's applications using
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), which is an online mobile
photo-sharing, video-sharing, and social networking service. The
Instagram authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator in
WSO2 Identity Server.
