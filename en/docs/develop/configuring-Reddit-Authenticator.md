### Deploying Reddit artifacts

-   Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/).

-   Download the Reddit authenticator from
    [here](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/details/45092602-8b7b-4f29-9d66-cc5b39990907)
    and add it to the
    `           <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins          `
    directory.

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade the Reddit Authenticator (.jar) in your
        existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)
    

### Configuring the Reddit App

1.  Create a reddit account using the URL
    [https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com/.) and log in.
2.  Navigate to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and click are you a
    developer?create an app on the top left corner. Example:
3.  Create a web app.  
    Use
    `                     https://localhost:9443/commonauth                   `
    as the **about url** and **redirect uri** when creating the web
    app.

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to [deploy the sample app](_Deploying_the_Sample_App_)
in order to use it in this scenario.

Once this is done, the next step is to configure the WSO2 Identity
Server by adding an [identity
provider](#ConfiguringRedditAuthenticator-ConfiguringanIdentityProvider)
and [service
provider](#ConfiguringRedditAuthenticator-ConfiguringaServiceProvider).

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by adding a new identity
provider. For more information about the Identity Providers, see
[Configuring an Identity
Provider](http://docs.wso2.com/identity-server/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
.

1.  Go to <https://www.reddit.com/> in your browser, and click the HTTPS
    trust icon on the address bar (e.g., the padlock next to the URL in
    Chrome) to download the certificate.  
    Based on the  browser the steps to download the certificate changes.
    Click valid under Certificate (Chrome) or click Show certificate
    (Safari), expand the **Details** section and click the URL under CA
    Issuer to download the certificate.  
    Example: On Chrome

    !!! note
    
        This is supported on Firefox and Safari browsers by default but it
        is not supported on some Chrome browsers.

        3.  Relaunch Chrome.
    

2.  Import that certificate into the IS client keystore.  
    `           keytool  -importcert -file <certificate file> -keystore  <IS>/repository/resources/security/client-truststore.jks -alias  "Reddit"          `

    The default password of the client-truststore.jks is "wso2carbon".

3.  Run the [WSO2 Identity
    Server](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Running+the+Product).
4.  Log in to the [management
    console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console)
    as an administrator.
5.  In the **Identity Providers** section under the **Main** tab of the

    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.

5.  Now set the configuration as follows:

    1.  **Issuer** : travelocity.com

You have now added and configured the service provider.

### Testing the sample

1.  To test the sample, go to the following URL:
    `           http://<TOMCAT_HOST>:<TOMCAT_PORT>/travelocity.com          `
    .  
    E.g., http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com

2.  Login with SAML from the WSO2 Identity Server.
