# TOTP Authenticator

The TOTP authenticator allows you to authenticate a user using
Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP) through WSO2 Identity Server. It
uses the TOTP specification to calculate the access tokens based on the
time and the shared secret key between the user and the identity
provider.

TOTP is a temporary passcode, generated by an algorithm, for use in
authenticating access to computer systems. The algorithm that generates
each password uses the current time of day as one of its factors,
ensuring that each password is unique.
