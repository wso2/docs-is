# Calling Admin Services

WSO2 products are managed internally using SOAP Web services known as
**admin services**. WSO2 products come with a management console UI,
which communicates with these admin services to facilitate
administration capabilities through the UI.

A service in WSO2 products is defined by the following components:

-   Service component: provides the actual service
-   UI component: provides the Web user interface to the service
-   Service stub: provides the interface to invoke the service generated
    from the service Web Services Description Language ( WSDL).

There can be instances where you want to call back-end Web services
directly. For example, in test automation, to minimize the overhead of
having to change automation scripts whenever a UI change happens,
developers prefer to call the underlying services in scripts. The topics
below explain how to discover and invoke these services from your
applications.

### Discovering the admin services

By default, the WSDLs of admin services are hidden from consumers. Given
below is how to discover them using the
[OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/developer/) console.

1.  Add the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
   
       ``` 
       [admin_service.wsdl] 
       enable= true
       ```
 
    
2.  Go to `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/          ` folder and start
    the WSO2 product as follows,

    ``` java tab="In Linux Environment"
    sh wso2server.sh -DosgiConsole
    ```

    ``` java tab="In Windows Environment"
    wso2server.bat -DosgiConsole
    ```

3.  Once the server starts, hit the enter/return key several times to
    get the OSGI shell in the console.

4.  In the OSGI shell, type: `          listAdminServices         `

5.  The list of admin services of your product are listed. For
    example:  
    ![Admin services list](../assets/img/using-wso2-identity-server/admin-services-list.png) 

**Things to note!**

!!! info
    To see the service contract of an admin service, select the admin
    service's URL and then paste it in your browser with **?wsdl** at the
    end. For example:

    `https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl`

    You should be accessing the Admin Services via the management console
    port, which is 9443 when there is no port offset.

!!! note 
    The admin service's URL appears as follows in the list you discovered in step 6:

    ``` java
    RemoteUserStoreManagerService, RemoteUserStoreManagerService, https://<host IP>:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService/  
    ```
    
    After discovering admin service you can restart the server without
    `           -DosgiConsole          `
    

###  Invoking an admin service

Admin services are secured using common types of security protocols,
such as HTTP basic authentication, WS-Security username token, and
session based authentication, to prevent anonymous invocations. For
example, the `         UserAdmin        ` Web service is secured with
the HTTP basic authentication. To invoke a service, you do the
following:

1.  Authenticate yourself and get the session cookie.
2.  Generate the client stubs to access the back-end Web services.

!!! tip
    
    To generate the stubs, you can write your own client program using the
    Axis2 client API or use an existing tool like
    [SoapUI](http://www.soapui.org/) (4.5.1 or later) or wsdl2java.
    
    The wsdl2java tool, which comes with WSO2 products by default hides all
    the complexity and presents you with a proxy to the back-end service.
    The stub generation happens during the project build process within the
    Maven POM files. It uses the Maven ant run plug-in to execute the
    wsdl2java tool.
    
    You can also use the Java client program given
    [here](https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/asela/user-mgt/remote-user-api/4.2.X/)
    to invoke admin services. All dependency JAR files that you need to run
    this client are found in the `         /lib        ` directory.
    

#### Authenticate the user

The example code below authenticates the user and gets the session
cookie: 

??? example "Click to view the code"
    ``` java
    import org.apache.axis2.AxisFault;  
    import org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants;  
    import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.AuthenticationAdminStub;  
    import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LoginAuthenticationExceptionException;  
    import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException;  
    import org.apache.axis2.context.ServiceContext;  
    import java.rmi.RemoteException;  
      
    public class LoginAdminServiceClient {  
      private final String serviceName = "AuthenticationAdmin";  
        private AuthenticationAdminStub authenticationAdminStub;  
        private String endPoint;  
      
        public LoginAdminServiceClient(String backEndUrl) throws AxisFault {  
          this.endPoint = backEndUrl + "/services/" + serviceName;  
          authenticationAdminStub = new AuthenticationAdminStub(endPoint);  
        }  
      
        public String authenticate(String userName, String password) throws RemoteException,  
                                          LoginAuthenticationExceptionException {  
      
          String sessionCookie = null;  
      
          if (authenticationAdminStub.login(userName, password, "localhost")) {  
            System.out.println("Login Successful");  
      
            ServiceContext serviceContext = authenticationAdminStub.  
                _getServiceClient().getLastOperationContext().getServiceContext();  
            sessionCookie = (String) serviceContext.getProperty(HTTPConstants.COOKIE_STRING);  
            System.out.println(sessionCookie);  
          }  
      
          return sessionCookie;  
        }  
      
        public void logOut() throws RemoteException, LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException {  
          authenticationAdminStub.logout();  
        }  
    }
    ```

!!! tip 
    
    - To resolve dependency issues, if any, add the following dependency JARs location to the class path:
    `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins`.        
    - The the `AuthenticationAdminStub` class requires `org.apache.axis2.context.ConfigurationContext` as a parameter. You can give a null value there.
    

#### Generate the client stubs

After authenticating the user, give the retrieved admin cookie with the
service endpoint URL as shown in the sample below. The service
management service name is ServiceAdmin. You can find its URL (e.g.,
`          https://localhost:9443/services/ServiceAdmin         ` ) in
the `          service.xml         ` file in the
`          META-INF         ` folder in the respective bundle that you
find in
`          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins         ` .

??? example "Click to view the code"
    ``` java
    import org.apache.axis2.AxisFault;  
    import org.apache.axis2.client.Options;  
    import org.apache.axis2.client.ServiceClient;  
    import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.ServiceAdminStub;  
    import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.types.carbon.ServiceMetaDataWrapper;  
    import java.rmi.RemoteException;  
      
    public class ServiceAdminClient {  
      private final String serviceName = "ServiceAdmin";  
      private ServiceAdminStub serviceAdminStub;  
      private String endPoint;  
      
      public ServiceAdminClient(String backEndUrl, String sessionCookie) throws AxisFault {  
        this.endPoint = backEndUrl + "/services/" + serviceName;  
        serviceAdminStub = new ServiceAdminStub(endPoint);  
        //Authenticate Your stub from sessionCooke  
        ServiceClient serviceClient;  
        Options option;  
      
        serviceClient = serviceAdminStub._getServiceClient();  
        option = serviceClient.getOptions();  
        option.setManageSession(true);  
        option.setProperty(org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants.COOKIE_STRING, sessionCookie);  
      }  
      
      public void deleteService(String[] serviceGroup) throws RemoteException {  
        serviceAdminStub.deleteServiceGroups(serviceGroup);  
      
      }  
      
      public ServiceMetaDataWrapper listServices() throws RemoteException {  
        return serviceAdminStub.listServices("ALL", "*", 0);  
      }  
    } 
    ```

The following sample code lists the back-end Web services:

        LoginAdminServiceClient login = new LoginAdminServiceClient(backEndUrl);  
        String session = login.authenticate("admin", "admin");  
        ServiceAdminClient serviceAdminClient = new ServiceAdminClient(backEndUrl, session);  
        ServiceMetaDataWrapper serviceList = serviceAdminClient.listServices();  
        System.out.println("Service Names:");  
        for (ServiceMetaData serviceData : serviceList.getServices()) {  
          System.out.println(serviceData.getName());  
        }  
      
        login.logOut();  
      }  
    }
