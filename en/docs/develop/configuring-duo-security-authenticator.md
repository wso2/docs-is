# Configuring Duo Security Authenticator

This topic provides instructions on how to configure the Duo Security
app and the Identity Server. A sample app is used to demonstrate this
integration. See the following sections for more information.

This is tested for the Duo Security API version V2.

### Configuring the Duo Security app

1.  Go to <https://duo.com> and click free signup and register.
2.  Log in to Duo Security. Click **Applications** from the left panel
    and then click the **Protect an Application** button.

3.  In the **Protect an Application** page, select **Auth API** from
    the list. **Auth API** credentials are **mandatory .**  
    ![](attachments/51486739/51451211.png)   
4.  Once the integration is created, you are given a **Secret key** and
    an **Integration key** for your integration. You can use these along
    with your Duo host when accessing Duo Security APIs.

5.  You can also configure the **Admin API** credentials if you need to
    validate the mobile numbers. When you verify the mobile number, use
    only these credentials. Navigate back to the **Protect an
    Application** page and select **Admin API** from the list. Once the
    Integration is created, you are given a **Secret key** and an
    **Integration key** for your integration.

    !!! warning
    
        **Important** : If you can not see the type “Admin API” in the
        dropdown, contact the Duo team through <support@duosecurity.com> and
        ask for Admin API permission.
    

    When configuring the Admin API, select the **Grant read resource**
    permission.

    !!! tip
    
        **Tip** : This step is mandatory if you need to verify the user's
        mobile number in the user store with the mobile number in Duo
        Security. This is configured in step 4 of [Deploying Duo Security
        artifacts](#ConfiguringDuoSecurityAuthenticator-DeployingDuoSecurityartifacts)
        .
    

### Deploying Duo Security artifacts

To download the authenticator and artifacts, go to [the WSO2
store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list?q=%22-default%22%3A%22duo%22)
.

1.  Place the `            duoauthenticationendpoint.war           `
    file into the
    `            <IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps           `
    directory.
2.  Place the
    `             org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.duo-1.0.2.jar            `
    file into the
    `             <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins            `
    directory.

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade the Duo Authenticator in your existing IS
        pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)
    

3.  Place the
    `                           okio-1.9.0.jar                         `
    into the
    `             <IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib            `
    directory.

    !!! tip
    
        You may have done this step already if you configured the [Duo
        Security Provisioning
        Connector](Configuring-Duo-Security-Provisioning-Connector). If
        so, you can skip this step.
    

4.  Optionally, to verify the user store user's mobile number with the
    same user's mobile number in Duo Security, add the following to the
    `             <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/application-authentication.xml            `
    file under the `             <AuthenticatorConfigs>            `
    section. This verification only requires the Admin API credentials.

    ``` java
    <AuthenticatorConfig name="DuoAuthenticator" enabled="true">
         <Parameter name="EnableMobileVerification">true</Parameter>
    </AuthenticatorConfig>
    ```

!!! tip
    
    **Tip** : Duo Security mainly uses Mobile Phone two-factor
    authentication to ensure secure login.
    
    
    **Important** : When you update the mobile claim in user profile, use
    the same format of mobile number with country code as you registered in
    the DUO site. (i.e +9477\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)
    

  

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to deploy the travelocity.com sample app in order to
use it in this scenario.

To do this, see the topic on [deploying the travelocity.com sample
app](Deploying-the-Sample-App).

### Configuring the identity provider

Now you have to configure WSO2 Identity Server by [adding a new identity
provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
.

1.  Download the WSO2 Identity Server from
    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/) and [run
    it](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Running+the+Product).
2.  Log in to the [management
    console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console)
    as an administrator.
3.  In the **Identity** section under the **Main** tab of the management
    console, click **Add** under **Identity Providers**.
4.  Give a suitable name as the **Identity Provider Name**.
5.  Go to **Duo Configuration** under **Federated Authenticators**.  
    ![](attachments/51486739/51451222.png) 
6.  Enter the values for **Integration Key**, **Secret Key**, **Admin
    Integration Key**, **Admin Secret Key** ( Admin Integration Key
    and Admin Secret Key are optional) and **Host**, as indicated in
    the above figure.
7.  Select both check-boxes to **Enable** the Duo Authenticator and make
    it the **Default**.
8.  Click **Register**.

You have now added the identity provider.  

### Configuring the service provider

The next step is to configure the service provider.

1.  Return to the management console.

2.  In the **Service Providers** section under the **Main** tab, click
    **Add**.

3.  Since you are using travelocity as the sample, enter travelocity.com
    in the **Service Provider Name** text box and click **Register**.

4.  In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.
    ![](attachments/48283197/48220892.png) 

5.  Now do the following configurations.

    1.  **Issuer** : travelocity.com

    2.  **Assertion Consumer URL** :
        [http://localhost:8081/travelocity.com/home.jsp](http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp)

6.  Select the following check boxes:
    1.  **Enable Response Signing**.

    2.  **Enable Single Logout**.

    3.  **Enable Attribute Profile**.

    4.  **Include Attributes in the Response Always**.  
        ![](attachments/51486739/51451223.png) 

7.  Click **Update** to save the changes. Now you will be sent back to
    the **Service Providers** page.
8.  Go to **Local and Outbound Authentication Configuration** section.
9.  Select the **Advanced Configuration** radio button option.  
    ![](attachments/51486739/51451225.png) 
10. Add the basic authentication as the first step and Duo
    authentication as the second step and click **Update** to save the
    changes.  
    ![](attachments/51486739/51451226.png) 

You have now added and configured the service provider.  

### Testing the sample

1.  To test the sample, go to the following URL:
    `            http://<TOMCAT_HOST>:<TOMCAT_PORT>/travelocity.com/.           `  
    E.g: <http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com>

2.  Click the link to log in with SAML from WSO2 Identity Server.  
    ![](attachments/48283197/48220894.png) 

3.  The basic authentication page appears. Log in using your username
    and password.  
    ![](attachments/51486739/51451227.png) 
4.  You are directed to the Duo Security authentication page.  
    ![](attachments/51486739/53284890.png) 
5.  If your verification is successful, you are taken to the home page
    of the travelocity.com app.
