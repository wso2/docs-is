# JWT Grant Type for OAuth2

The JSON Web Token bearer grant is simply a JSON string containing claim
values that will be evaluated and validated by the JWT Grant Handlers at
the Authorization Server end before issuing an access token.

WSO2 Identity Server as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server can accept
JSON Web Token(JWT) Assertions from OAuth 2.0 clients as a means of
resource owner authentication and authorization. Additionally, it can
exchange it with OAuth 2.0 access tokens in order to access protected
resources on behalf of the resource owner.
