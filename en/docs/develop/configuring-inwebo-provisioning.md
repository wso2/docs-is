    the
    `             <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins            `
    directory.

    !!! note
    
        If you want to upgrade the Inwebo Provisioning Connector (.jar) in
        your existing IS pack, please refer [upgrade
        instructions.](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ISCONNECTORS/Authenticator+Upgrade+Instructions)

    .  

### Deploying travelocity.com sample app

The next step is to deploy the travelocity.com sample app in order to
use it in this scenario.

To configure this, see [Deploying the Sample
App](Deploying-the-Sample-App).

provider](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Configuring+an+Identity+Provider)
.

    [here](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/), copy the
    [axis2\_inwebo.xml](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-outbound-provisioning-inwebo/blob/master/component/provisioning-connector/resources/axis2_inwebo.xml)
    into the `           <IS-HOME>/repository/conf/axis2          `
    directory and [start  up the Identity
    Server](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Running+the+Product).
2.  Log in to the [management
    console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console)
    as an administrator.
3.  In the **Identity** section under the **Main** tab of the management
    console, click **Add** under **Claims**.
