# Pinterest Authenticator

The Pinterest authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator
in WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate Pinterest users to log in to
your organization’s applications. Pinterest is a social network that
allows users to visually share, and discover new interests by posting
images or videos to their own or others' boards and browsing what other
users have pinned. The diagram below illustrates the flow of the
Printrest federated authenticator.
