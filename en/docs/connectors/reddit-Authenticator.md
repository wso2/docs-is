# Reddit Authenticator

The Reddit authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator in
WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate Reddit users to log in to your
organization’s applications. Reddit is a platform for creating
communities and is made up of thousands of active communities (known as
"subreddits"), which are devoted to all sorts of different topics and
are created and maintained by regular users. The diagram below
illustrates the flow of the Reddit federated authenticator.
