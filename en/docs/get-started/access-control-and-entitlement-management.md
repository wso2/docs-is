# Access Control and Entitlement Management

Today, enterprise applications seek ways of enforcing security that
allows the right people to access the right resources with restrictions
enforced by enterprise policies. Identity and entitlement management
systems, as a whole, attempt to address these security considerations.
These systems help enterprise architects and developers in their
application requirement implementations and try to significantly ease
the burden of security-related implementations. These identity and
entitlement management systems are governed by industry standard
specifications, hence supporting security requirements for heterogeneous
applications becomes easy.

### Types of access control

![The various types of access control](../../assets/img/getting-started/types-of-access-control.png)

The following table describes the various types of access control.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Access Control Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Access Control Lists</p></td>
<td>Access control lists are the oldest and most basic form of access control. This type was primarily adopted for use in operating systems. This maintains a set of users and operations that can be performed on a resource as a mapping. This is easy to implement due to the use of maps. However, this is not scalable for larger user bases and can become difficult to manage.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Role-based Access Control</p></td>
<td><p>Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is an approach used to restrict access to authorized users based on their role. This is a static permission model which provides access control. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 users.</p>
<p>This access control type is used when all users are categorized into different roles. The roles define the resources that can be accessed by users assigned to that role. This type of access control reduces management overhead. These users and roles can also be externalized using user stores. These roles need to be managed carefully. There can be instances where a user is assigned to multiple roles. This is a subset of ABAC.</p>
<p>Static permissions for roles can be given by updating permission tree in WSO2 Identity Server. Click <a href="../../learn/configuring-roles-and-permissions">here</a> for information on Configuring roles and permissions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Attribute-based Access Control</p></td>
<td><p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) defines a new access control paradigm whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies that combine attributes together.</p>
<p>Here, authorization happens based on attributes. This access control type addresses the limitations of role-based access control to provide a more fine-grained approach. This can be based on the attributes of the user, the environment, or even the resource itself. This is more flexible when compared with the role-based approach. There is no need to know the user prior to granting access.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Policy-based Access Control</p></td>
<td><p>This type of access control addresses the requirement to have a more uniform access control mechanism. This helps larger enterprises to have uniform access control for the large amount of organizational units. This is helpful when carrying out security audits.</p>
<p>This is the most complex form of access control. This involves specifying policies unambiguously using XACML and using authorized attribute sources in the enterprise. Here Policy Based Access Control(PBAC) (also called Rule-based access control) is an extension of ABAC where attributes are used in writing policies.</p></td>

### Introducing XACML

XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) is an XML-based
language for access control that has been standardized by the Technical
Committee of the OASIS consortium. XACML is popular as a fine grain
authorization method among the community. However, there are aspects of
XACML that surpasses other policy standards by being a fine-grained
authorization mechanism.

Although XACML was introduced as a standard by OASIS in 2003, not many
organizations that have adopted it yet. This is because most
organization's lack of interest in moving towards a XACML based solution
for authorization. The following can be some of the reasons for this:

-   Many software designer and developers lack a clear understanding
    of features, importance, and advantages of XACML.
-   It is comparatively difficult to implement a XACML solution when
    compared with a typical JDBC or hard-coded authorization system.
-   Performance of XACML-based authorization system may be less than
    adequate.
-   The complexity of defining and managing XACML policies.

However, current market trends indicate that there is some motivation
for XACML-based authorization systems. This section includes some
architectural and implementation details on XACML with an existing XACML
engine.

To summarize, XACML describes both an access control policy language,
request/response language, and reference architecture. The policy
language is used to express access control policies (who can do what,
when). The request/response language expresses queries about whether a
particular access should be allowed (requests) and describes answers to
those queries(responses). The reference architecture proposes a standard
for deployment of necessary software modules within an infrastructure to
allow efficient enforcement of policies.

WSO2 Identity Server uses XACML as a tool for controlling access to
applications.

!!! Info "Recommended reading"
    For more information on XACML specifications and other related
    information, see [the OASIS 
    website](http://oasis-open.org/committees/xacml "(target|_blank)").

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why XACML

Most of the organizations still use legacy systems with inbuilt
authorization logic. Sometimes, one organization contains a large number
of information systems and applications that each system or application
uses for their own process for authorization. Today, authorization has
become more complex because users within organizations and outside need
access to shared data and have the need to collaborate efficiently.
Therefore, this has been challenging task to manage these
legacy systems, custom authorization systems. However, XACML offers a
solution to this problem.

Most traditional authorization systems mostly have the following
features:

-   Authorization logic is hard-coded into the source code.
-   Authorization logic is stored in databases that could only be
    readable and understandable by the underlying application

The following are the some goals that current organizations are looking
at from an authorization system.

-   Can business managers (who should determine how access controls
    would be implemented) define and modify different authorization
    logic?
-   Can we find new IT technicians to manage these legacy systems?
    Especially when those who developed the system have left the
    organization?
-   Can different authorization logic be modified without any source
    code changes in a dynamic way?
-   Is authorization system capable of evaluating following rule? “X
    resource can be accessed by the Users who are from
    [example.com](http://example.com) domain and whose age is greater
    than 21 years old”
-   If we are going to implement a new information system with the
    organization, can we re-use the authorization logic of a legacy
    system?
-   Can we achieve a fine-grained authorization level without defining
    a large number of static combinations?
-   Are the authorization systems capable of answering the questions
    such as: “Can a user, Bob, transfer X amount from Y current account
    at 1.00pm?“

Clearly, the above goals cannot be achieved from a traditional
authorization system. However, a XACML-based authorization solution can
help to achieve all of these goals, because XACML:

-   is a standard which is ratified by OASIS standards organization.
-   is a policy language implemented using XML which is an industry
    standard.
-   supports Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) and evaluation can be
    done with the additional data retrieved from Policy Information
    Point (PIP) which is defined by the XACML reference architecture.

	!!! note   
    
    	##### Attribute-based Access Control(ABAC)
    
    	ABAC is an access control paradigm whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of
    	policies which combine attributes together. The policies can use any
    	type of attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, object,
    	environment attributes etc.). This model supports boolean logic, in
    	which rules contain "IF, THEN" statements about who is making the
    	request, the resource, and the action. For example: IF the requestor is
    	a manager, THEN allow read/write access to sensitive data.
    
-   contains reference architecture which is provided to externalize the
    authorization system. The Policy Decision Point (PDP) offers
    authorization as a service in your infrastructure. Authorization
    algorithms can be removed from the application logic and
    applications can query the PDP via their own Policy Enforcement
    Points (PEP).
-   provides fine-grained authorization with higher level of abstraction
    by means of policies and rules.
-   supports dynamic evaluation of policies by using the Policy
    Information Point (PIP).
-   can publish multiple policies into external PDPs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XACML system architecture

Policy Decision Point (PDP) evaluates policies against access requests
provided by Policy Enforcement Points (PEP). To provide the decisions,
PDP may also need to query a Policy Information Point (PIP) to gather
descriptive attributes about the user or any other missing attribute in
the request. Policy Administration Point (PAP) is used to manage the PDP
and PIP functionality.

![XACML system architecture](../../assets/img/getting-started/xacml-system-architecture.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XACML terminology

The XACML reference architecture illustrated above is comprised of
the following four 'building blocks'.

-   **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** : The system entity that performs
    access control by making decision requests and enforcing
    authorization decisions. This is the entity that sends the XACML
    request to the Policy Decision Point (PDP) and receives an
    authorization decision.
-   **Policy Decision Point (PDP)** : The system entity that evaluates
    an applicable policy and returns an authorization decision.
-   **Policy Information Point (PIP)** : The system entity that acts as
    a source of attribute values. If there are missing attributes in the
    XACML request that is sent by PEP, PIP would find them for the PDP
    to evaluate the policy.
-   **Policy Administration Point (PAP)** : The system entity that
    creates a policy or policy set and manages them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XACML engine architecture 

The WSO2 Identity Server is a major player in the XACML and open source
world. The Identity Server supports XACML 3.0, which is based on [Balana
XACML implementation](https://github.com/wso2/balana). As the source
code, distribution and documentation are available for free, it is
possible to analyze and understand the architecture behind it. You can
find source code from
[here](https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/commons/balana/).

This section provides some information regarding the architecture of the
XACML engine (or the entitlement engine) of the WSO2 Identity Server.

The XACML engine of the WSO2 Identity Server has two major components,
i.e., PAP and PDP. The section below focuses on Policy Decision
Point (PDP).

The following diagram represents the component architecture of the PDP.

![Component architecture of the policy decision point](../../assets/img/getting-started/xacml-engine-architecture.png)

The following provides a more detailed information on the various
components available in the PDP architecture.

**Entitlement Admin Service**

All PDP configurations are exposed via this API as a Web service which
you need to have certain privileges to access. The following functions
can be done by calling this API.

-   Invalidating caches
-   Refreshing policy, attribute, resource finder modules
-   Retrieving PDP configurations
-   Includes the function for testing the Test PDP with a given sample
    request or a sample request with given policies

**Entitlement Service**

Actual XACML authorization API is exposed via this API as a Web service.
This service supports the following three communication methods with
PEP.

-   SOAP-based Web service
-   Thrift binary protocol (this is much faster than SOAP)
-   WS-XACML (This is the standard way but not popular)

**Balana PDP**

This is the core of the engine. Balana PDP has been initialized with all
the attribute finders, resource finders and policy finder modules that
are plugged with WSO2 Identity Server.

**Balana Test PDP**

This is same as Balana PDP. However, this instance has been initialized
with the PAP policy store. It means, policies that are defined by PAP
can be evaluated by using this PDP instance. There is no policy caching
or decision caching with this. Therefore, this can only be used for
testing your policies in the PAP store. Web service API for Balana Test
PDP is exposed via the Entitlement Admin Service with method name
“doTestRequest()”.

**Carbon Policy Finder**

This module finds  from different policy stores to evaluate a
XACML request. The following is a high-level diagram of how this works.

![Carbon policy finder](../../assets/img/getting-started/carbon-policy-finder.png)

Any number of policy finder modules can be plugged with the Carbon
policy finder. You need to implement the CarbonPolicyFinderModule
interface to write a new module and register it using the configuration
file called `entitlement.properties.xml` in 
`<IS_HOME>/repository/components/features/org.wso2.carbon.identity.xacml.server_5.8.145 directory`
. By default, WSO2 Identity Server is shipped with a Carbon
registry-based policy finder module that can retrieve ppoliciesolicies from a
registry collection, where the collection path is configurable using a
property value in the entitlement.properties.xml file.

All modules are initialized and policies are loaded into memory when the
Carbon policy finder is used. Loaded policies are kept as a policy
collection where you can use your own implementation to access them. A
written policy collection implementation can be registered using the
entitlement.properties.xml file. The default implementation uses an
in-memory cache and creates an effective policy for a given XACML
request.

Therefore, the Carbon policy finder always finds effective policies from
the policy collection where it is recommended to be kept in-memory.
However, if any update in the policy store happens, the Carbon policy
finder can be re-initialized automatically by the module that you have
written, or you can re-initialize it by using the Web service API
(Entitlement Admin Service). Alternatively, you can do it manually using
the Identity Server Management Console.

When you are writing a new module, you need to consider the following in
addition to policy retrieving and re-initializing.

-   Policy ordering - The order which policies are evaluated.
-   Policy combining algorithm
	  
	!!! note   
		There are **Policy Combining Algorithms** which are used by *Policy
		Sets* and **Rule Combining Algorithms** which are used by *Policies*
		. Each of the algorithms mentioned below has its Policy Combining
		algorithm and its Rule Combining algorithms as follows:

		-   Standard combining algorithms defined in XACML 3.0:
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:deny-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:permit-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:permit-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:1.0:rule-combining-algorithm:first-applicable
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:1.0:policy-combining-algorithm:first-applicable
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:1.0:policy-combining-algorithm:only-one-applicable
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:ordered-deny-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:ordered-deny-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:ordered-permit-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:ordered-permit-overrides
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-unless-permit
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:permit-unless-deny
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:deny-unless-permit
			-   urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:permit-unless-deny
	
		These algorithms are explained in detail as follows,
		
		-   **Deny Overrides:**  
			This combining algorithm combines decisions in such a way that
			if any decision is a Deny, then that decision wins.  
			Deny overrides is one of the safest combining algorithms since
			it favors a Deny decision. However, if none of the children
			return a Deny decision, then the combining algorithm will never
			produce a Deny.  
		  
		-   **Permit Overrides:**  
			This combining algorithm combines decisions in such a way that
			if any decision is a Permit, then that decision wins.

		The permit overrides combining algorithm can be interesting when:

		At least one child must return a Permit for access to be granted
		overall, regardless of restrictions.

		One wants to return all the reasons why access is being denied. This
		is what one could call a “greedy deny overrides”.For instance, if the
		reason for not being able to view a resource is that (a) you are not
		the owner and (b) you are in the wrong department, we could
		rework the previous example as follows. 
		When a deny reason triggers, the response would be denied with all the applicable
		reasons for access being denied:

		-   Policy Set (deny overrides): role==manager AND action==view
			AND resourceType==resource
			-   Policy 1 (permit overrides)
				-   Rule 1: deny if resourceOwner != userId +
						Advice(“you are not the owner of the resource”)
				-   Rule 2: deny if rsourceDepartment != userDepartment+
						Advice(“you are not in the same department as the
						resource)
			-   Policy 2
				-   Rule 1: permit
 
		-   **First Applicable:**  
			This combining algorithm combines decisions in such a way that
			the final decision returned is the first one produced either of
			Permit or Deny. 
			First applicable is useful to shortcut policy evaluation. For
			instance, if a policy set contains a long series of not
			applicable policies and one applicable policy which returns
			either of Permit or Deny, then if that policy comes first and
			does produce Permit or Deny, the PDP will stop there and not
			process the other siblings.  

		-   **Deny Unless Permit \| Permit Unless Deny:**  
			In XACML there are 4 possible decisions: Permit, Deny,
			NotApplicable, and Indeterminate. Sometimes, it is desirable to
			hide the NotApplicable and Indeterminate decisions to only allow
			for Permit or Deny. It makes the PEP logic potentially simpler.

		-   **Only One Applicable:**
			This combining algorithm exists only for policy sets to combine
			policy sets and policies. It cannot be used to combine rules. With
			this combining algorithm, in order for either of a Permit or Deny to
			be returned, then only one of the children must produce a valid
			decision – whether Deny or Permit.

		-   **Ordered Deny Overrides \| Ordered Permit Overrides:**  
			The ordered combining algorithms combine decisions in the same
			way as their (unordered) cousins. In, addition they bring the
			guarantee that policies, policy sets, and rules are considered
			in the order in which they are defined. The need to define an
			ordered combining algorithm stems from the fact the XACML
			specification does not specify whether order matters in the
			deny-overrides and permit-overrides combining algorithms.
    

-   How to retrieve referenced policies

**Carbon Attribute Finder**

This module helps to find the missing attribute for a given XACML
request. The following is the high-level diagram for both the Carbon
attribute and resource finders.

![Carbon attribute finder](../../assets/img/getting-started/carbon-attribute-finder.png)

Any number of PIP attribute finder modules can be plugged with the
Carbon attribute finder. You need to implement the PIPAttributeFinder
interface to write a new module and register it using the
entitlement.properties configuration file. By default, WSO2 Identity
Server is shipped with a DefaultAttributeFinder that communicates with
the underlying user store of the Identity Server. The default user store
of the Identity Server is ApacheDS where it can be changed using
user-mgt.xml file. See [Configuring the
Realm](../../learn/configuring-the-realm) for
more information.

All modules would be initialized and supported attribute Ids are
retrieved for each module. During runtime, the Carbon attribute finder
checks for the support attribute Id and hands it over to the proper
module to handle. A caching machine is used by the Carbon attribute
finder for caching the findings or the attribute finder module itself
can handle it.

**Carbon Resource Finder**

This is used to retrieve children or descendant resources of a given
root level resource value. Basically, it is used to fulfill the
requirement of a multiple decision profile. The implementation is same
as the PIP attribute finder module. By default, WSO2 Identity Server is
shipped with DefaultResourceFinder (which is the implementation of
PIPResourceFinder) that communicates with Carbon registry resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XACML policy language structure and syntax

In order to render an authorization decision, it is possible to combine
the two separate policies to form the single policy applicable to the
request.

XACML defines three top-level policy elements:

-   Element that contains a *boolean* expression that can be
    evaluated in isolation, but that is not intended to be accessed in
    isolation by a PDP. So, it is not intended to form the basis of an
    authorization decision by itself. It is intended to exist in
    isolation only within an XACML PAP, where it may form the basic
    unit of management.  
-   Element that contains a set of elements and a specified procedure
    for combining the results of their evaluation. It is the basic unit
    of policy used by the PDP, and so it is intended to form the basis
    of an authorization decision.  
-   Element that contains a set of or other elements and a specified
    procedure for combining the results of their evaluation. It is the
    standard means for combining separate policies into a single
    combined policy.

As XACML is used in Attribute-based Access Controlling, in XACML all the
attributes are categorized into the following four main categories: But
from XACML 3.0, custom categories are also supported.

-   Subject
-   Resource
-   Action
-   Environment

A Rule is the most elementary unit of policy. It may exist in
isolation only within one of the major actors of the XACML domain. The
main components of a Rule are as follows:

-   <<zero-width space>Target<zero-width space>>- This defines the set of requests to which the rule is intended to
    apply in the form of a logical expression on attributes in the
    request.
-   <<zero-width space>Effect<zero-width space>>- The effect of the rule indicates the rule-writer's intended
    consequence of a "True" evaluation of the rule. Two values are allowed: "Permit" and "Deny".
-   <<zero-width space>Condition<zero-width space>>- A Boolean expression that refines the applicability of the rule
    beyond the predicates implied by its target. Therefore, it may be
    absent.
-   <<zero-width space>ObligationExpressions<zero-width space>>- Obligation expressions may be added by the writer of the policy.
    When a PDP evaluates a policy containing obligation expressions, it
    evaluates the obligation expressions into obligations and returns
    certain of those obligations to the PEP in the response context.
-   <<zero-width space>AttributeSelector<zero-width space>>- This allows the
    policy to specify an attribute with given identifier, category and
    data type. The AttributeSelector on the other hand, provides a mean
    to lookup the value of attributes using a XPath query by specifying
    the data type and XPath expression. Attribute selectors are then
    executed against the XML content that may have been sent along in
    the initial XACML request.

A sample XACML 3.0 policy is as follows:

``` xml
<Policy xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17" PolicyId="samplePolicy" RuleCombiningAlgId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-overrides" Version="1.0">
    <Target>
        <AnyOf>
            <AllOf>
                <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                    <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">read</AttributeValue>
                    <AttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id" Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" MustBePresent="true"/>
                </Match>
            </AllOf>
        </AnyOf>
    </Target>
    <Rule Effect="Permit" RuleId="permit"/>
</Policy>
```

###  Improvements in XACML 3.0

The XACML 3.0 core specification highlights the following main changes
in comparison with XACML 2.0.

#### Custom attribute categories

Custom attribute categories can be defined with XACML 3.0. However, in
XACML 2.0, attributes have been organized into subject, resource,
environment or action. For instance, lets's say that you want to create
an attribute category called “foo” in your policy and request. You can
do it with XACML 3.0 easily. According to the XACML 3.0 policy schema,
the category of XACML element is identified by a XML attribute called “
`         Category        ` ”.

In XACML 2.0 Policy, you can define the attribute designator element as
follows, However, it must be a pre-defined category such as subject,
resource, environment or action.

``` java
<ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
```

In a XACML 3.0 Policy, you can define it as follows.
`         Category        ` can be anything as it is defined as an
attribute of the `         AttributeDesignator        ` element.

``` java
<AttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id" Category="resource" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
```

#### Improvements in `         Obligation        `

In general, obligations can have the following:

-   An Obligation has an identifier, which is used to distinguish
    different types of obligations
-   An Obligation can have arguments
-   Obligations apply to Permit (or Deny) decisions only

A PDP will return, as part of a Permit or Deny response, a (possibly
empty) subset of the obligations that appear in the policy.

There are several improvements with Obligations in XACML 3.0 when
compared to 2.0.

One of the main improvements is the introduction of **Obligation
Expressions**. This adds dynamic expressions into the obligation
statements. For a more in-depth understanding, see the following
example:

Let's assume that you want to do following with the Obligation: “On
deny, inform the PEP to send an email to the user”.

In XACML 2.0, you need to define the obligation element with the user
email statically.

``` java
<Obligation ObligationId="send-email" FulfillOn="Deny">
    <AttributeAssignment AttributeId="email" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">user@foo.com</AttributeAssignment>
</Obligation>
```

However, the user may not be same for each XACML request that is
evaluated. Therefore it is not possible to configure the email
statically in the `         Obligation        ` element. Obligation can
only inform PEP to send an email to user (it lets the PEP figure out the
value of user’s email).

``` java
<Obligation ObligationId="send-email" FulfillOn="Deny">
    <AttributeAssignment AttributeId="text" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">please send email to user</AttributeAssignment>
</Obligation>
```

However, in XACML 3.0, the email of each user can be retrieved using PIP
in dynamically as we can define an expression element inside the
`         ObligationExpression        ` . Therefore, obligation can
inform PEP to send an email to <user@foo.com> address.

``` java
<ObligationExpression ObligationId="send-email" FulfillOn="Deny">
    <AttributeAssignmentExpression AttributeId="email" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
        <AttributeDesignator AttributeId="email" Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" MustBePresent="false"/>
    </AttributeAssignmentExpression>
</ObligationExpression>
```

In XACML 2.0, obligations can only be added to policies and policy sets.
However, with XACML 3.0, rules can also contain obligations. At the root
of all XACML policies, is a policy or a policy set . A policy represents
a single access control policy, expressed through a set of rules. A
policy set is a container that can hold other policies or policy sets,
as well as references to policies found in remote locations.

#### Introducing `         Advice        `

`         Advice        ` is a newly introduced feature with XACML 3.0.
Advice is similar to obligations and it shares much of its syntax. The
difference is contractual: the PEP can disregard any advice it receives.
PEPs do not have to comply with advice statements; PEPs can consider or
discard the statement. A common scenario is to explain why something was
denied: “User bob is denied because he does not have a valid email”.

The XACML specification says that any advice returned with a decision
can be safely ignored by compliant PEPs. This means that PEPs should
work as described in the previous section, regardless of what the PEP
does with the advice it may receive. For example, a PEP must allow
access if it receives a Permit decision with no obligations, regardless
of any advice in the decision.

#### Improvements in `         Target        `

Since it is possible to define custom attribute categories, there are
improvements in some related elements in the XACML 3.0 policy, when
compared to 2.0. With XACML 3.0, the `         Target        ` element
can be used to define more complex authorization logic within itself
when compared with 2.0.

In XACML 2.0, the `         Target        ` element contains the OR and
AND relationship between the same category. However, in XACML 3.0,
`         AllOf        ` and `         AnyOf        ` elements have been
introduced to `         Target        ` element. That clearly helps to
define the OR and AND relationship between different categories.

As an example, let's look at a `         Target        ` element. In
XACML 2.0, we have an `         AND        ` relationship between
**foo1** and **foo2** resources and an `         OR        `
relationship between **bar1** and **bar2** actions. However, we cannot
create an `         OR        ` relationship between a **foo1** resource
and **bar1** action. so we cannot define something such as “Target would
be matched when Bob can access the **foo** resource or do a **bar**
action” by using the `         Target        ` element.

``` java
<Target>
     <Resources>
         <Resource>
             <ResourceMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">foo1</AttributeValue>
                 <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
             </ResourceMatch>
             <ResourceMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">foo2</AttributeValue>
                 <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
             </ResourceMatch>
         </Resource>
     </Resources>
     <Actions>
         <Action>
             <ActionMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">bar1</AttributeValue>
                 <ActionAttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
             </ActionMatch>
         </Action>
         <Action>
             <ActionMatch MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">bar2</AttributeValue>
                 <ActionAttributeDesignator AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
             </ActionMatch>
         </Action>
     </Actions>
</Target>
```

XACML 3.0 has an `AND` relationship between “ **foo** ”
resource and **bar1** role and an `OR` relationship
between **bar2** action. So we cannot define something as “Target
would be matched, when Bob can access **foo** resource and do **bar1**
action or do **bar2** action”.

``` java
<Target>
     <AnyOf>
         <AllOf>
             <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-regexp-match">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">foo</AttributeValue>
                 <AttributeDesignator MustBePresent="false" Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id" DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
             </Match>
             <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">
                 <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">bar1</AttributeValue>
                 <AttributeDesignator MustBePresent="false" Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action"

         <AllOf>
             <Match MatchId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal">

                 <AttributeDesignator MustBePresent="false" Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action"

#### More Functions and Algorithms

XACML3 has introduced new String functions such as:

-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:string-starts-with           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:string-ends-with           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:string-contains           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:string-substring           `

Some improvements to other functions such as:

-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:dayTimeDuration-equal           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:yearMonthDuration-equal           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:dateTime-add-dayTimeDuration           `

Also improvements to existing combine algorithms (deny-overrides,
permit-overrides, ordered-deny-overrides and ordered-permit-overrides)
and new two combine algorithms for policy and rule combining.

-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-unless-permit           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:deny-unless-permit           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:rule-combining-algorithm:permit-unless-deny           `
-   `            urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:policy-combining-algorithm:permit-unless-deny           `

#### Improvements in XPath

New XPath data type is introduced with XACML 3.0. In XACML 2.0, XPath is
defined as a String and cannot define the context that the namespace
prefix is going to resolve. Also XPath based multiple decisions scheme
is introduced with XACML 3.0.

#### Improvement in XACML Request and Response

As it is possible to define custom attribute categories, many types of
attribute categories can be in the XACML 3.0 request. XACML 2.0 request
can contain only subject, resource, environment or action categories.

The XACML Response can contain additional data such as:

-   Request attributes that are defined in the XACML response.
-   Applicable policy ids for a given XACML request are defined in the
    XACML response.

#### XACML 3.0 Multiple Decision Profile

This is a useful profile that allows you to request more than one access
control decision in a single XACML request context, and also allows you
to request a single combined decision based on multiple individual
decisions.

The [XACML 3.0 Multiple Decision
Profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-multiple-v1-spec-cd-03-en.html)
(MDP) is particularly useful in scenarios where the PEP needs to request
decisions for multiple requests in one XACML request, and provides a
considerable improvement in performance between the PEP and the PDP in
such scenarios.

For a set of tutorials that demonstrate how to work with XACML MDP
requests in WSO2 Identity Server, see [Working with XACML Multiple
Decision Profile
Requests](../../tutorials/working-with-xacml-multiple-decision-profile-requests)
.

#### XACML 3.0 JSON Profile

This is a new profile that provides a standardized interface between
the PEP and the PDP using JSON. The decision request and response
structure is specified in the core XACML specification.

With the introduction of the [XACML 3.0 JSON
profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/xacml-json-http/v1.0/xacml-json-http-v1.0.html)
, WSO2 Identity Server supports the JSON format in addition to the
default XML format with regard to XACML 3.0 requests and responses.

!!! tip
    
    WSO2 Identity Server also supports [working with XACML MDP requests and
    responses in JSON
    format](../../tutorials/working-with-mdp-requests-in-json-format)
    .
    

  
Following are some of the key points to keep in mind when you work with
XACML 3.0 JSON requests and responses via WSO2 Identity Server:

-   Certain parts of JSON requests and responses have default values to
    avoid bloating. For example, the default value of the data-type of
    an attribute should be
    [string](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string).

-   The name of the XACML XML attribute element has changed to the
    category object in JSON so that it is possible to call the parent
    element.

-   The `          <AttributeValue>         ` element in the XML
    representation no longer exists. Instead a value property is
    introduced to the attribute object.
-   The `          AdviceId         ` and the
    `          ObligationId         ` attributes of
    `          <Advice/>         ` and
    `          <Obligation/>         ` XML elements are renamed to
    `          Id         ` in JSON.
-   The order of objects and values in the serialized form (JSON) does
    not matter in XACML.
-   You can use the short name of identifiers instead of the URI.
    Following are the supported identifier URIs and the short name for
    each:

    | Identifier URI                                                                         | Short name          |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|

    | urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action               | Action              |
    | urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:environment          | Environment         |
    | urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:access-subject       | AccessSubject       |
    | urn:oasis:names:<zero-width space>tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:recipient-subject    | RecipientSubject    |

-   ### <a name="shortnames"></a>The JSON format supports the fully qualified XACML data-type URI, and also supports the short name of the data-type.

-   `           xpathExpression          ` data-type values are
    represented as JSON objects, and each object contains the following
    properties:

    | Attribute     | Type                            | Required                                                                                                                         | Default value |
    |---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
    | XPathCategory | URI                             | Yes. You can use the [short names defined for identifier URIs](#shortnames) as values here. | None          |
    | Namespaces    | Array of namespace declarations | No                                                                                                                               | None          |
    | XPath         | String                          | Yes                                                                                                                              | None          |

-   The namespaces property should contain the following properties:

    | Attribute | Type   | Required | Default value |
    |-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
    | Prefix    | String | No       | None          |
    | Namespace | URI    | Yes      | None          |

      
    Following is a sample JSON attribute format that contains the fully
    qualified XACML data-type URI:

    ``` java
    {
        "Attribute": {
           "AttributeId": "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:content-selector",
           "DataType": "xpathExpression",
           "Value": {
                   "XPathCategory": "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource",
                   "Namespaces": [{
                           "Namespace":   "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17"
                           }, {
                           "Prefix": "md",
                           "Namespace":   "urn:example:med:schemas:record"
                               }],
                   "XPath":"md:record/md:patient/md:patientDoB"
            }
       }
    }
    ```

-   The `          MultiRequests         ` object is optional in the
    JSON representation of XACML. The purpose of the
    `          MultiRequests         ` object is to support the XACML
    multiple decision profile.
-   The JSON attribute object contains an array of attribute objects.
    The attribute object contains the following properties:

    | Property name   | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Required | Default value                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The identifier used in the XML representation of a XACML attribute will be used in its JSON representation                                                                                                             |

-   The results of the JSON request is represented by the decision
    object in the form of a JSON Object. This can have following
    properties:

    | Property name | Type   | Required                                                             | Default value |
    |---------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
    | Decision      | String | Yes. Possible values are: Permit, Deny, NotApplicable, Indeterminate | None.         |

-   The results can have the `          status         `,
    `          obligations         `,
    `          associatedAdvice         `,
    `          category         `, and
    `          policyIdentifierList         `, which are optional.

Following is a sample JSON request that you can try out with WSO2
Identity Server:

``` java
{
   "Request": {
      "AccessSubject": {
         "Attribute": [
            {
               "AttributeId": "subject-id",
               "Value": "sam",
               "DataType": "string",
               "IncludeInResult": true
            }
         ]
      },
     
      "Resource": {
         "Attribute": [
            {
               "AttributeId": "resource-id",
               "Value": "index.jsp",
               "DataType": "string",
               "IncludeInResult": true
            }
         ]
      },
      "Action": {
            "Attribute": [{
                    "AttributeId": "action-id",
                    "Value": "modify-welcome",
                    "DataType": "string",
                    "IncludeInResult": true
                }
            ]
        }
        
   }
}
```

  
Following is a sample XACML JSON response that you will get for the
above request:

``` java
{
    "Response": [
        {
            "Decision": "Deny",
            "Status": {
                "StatusCode": {
                    "Value": "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:ok"
                }
            },
            "AccessSubject": {
                "Attribute": [
                    {
                        "AttributeId": "subject-id",

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Resource": {
                "Attribute": [

                        "DataType": "string"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Action": {
                "Attribute": [

                        "IncludeInResult": "true",
                        "DataType": "string"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For a tutorial that demonstrate how WSO2 IS supports fine-grained
authorization using XACML requests in JSON format, see [Fine-grained
Authorization using XACML Requests in JSON
Format](../../tutorials/fine-grained-authorization-using-xacml-requests-in-json-format).

#### Administrative Delegation Profile

This is also a new profile that comes with XACML 3.0. This allows you to
define policies about who can write policies about what. For
example, “Bob may issue a policy but only about resources in department
X”.

### XACML 2.0 and XACML 3.0 samples

The biggest difference between XACML 2.0 and XACML 3.0 for your client
app is that the structure of the attributes in the authentication
request has changed significantly in XACML 3.0.

In XACML 2.0, attributes were organized into subject, resource,
environment, or action categories using XML element tags:

``` xml
<Request  xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context:schema:os"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context:schema:os  access_control-xacml-2.0-context-schema-os.xsd">
        <Subject>
            <Attribute
                  AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject:subject-id"
                  DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
                <AttributeValue>Julius Hibbert</AttributeValue>
            </Attribute>
        </Subject>
        <Resource>
            <Attribute
                  AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id"
                  DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI">
                <AttributeValue>http://medico.com/record/patient/BartSimpson</AttributeValue>
            </Attribute>
        </Resource>
        <Action>
            <Attribute
                  AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id"
                  DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
                <AttributeValue>read</AttributeValue>
            </Attribute>
        </Action>
        <Environment/>
</Request>
```

In XACML 3.0, these categories are indicated using XML attributes
instead of XML element tags:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Request xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17 http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-core-v3-schema-wd-17.xsd" ReturnPolicyIdList="false" CombinedDecision="false" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Attributes Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject">
    <Attribute IncludeInResult="false" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject:subject-id">
      <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Julius Hibbert</AttributeValue>
    </Attribute>
  </Attributes>
  <Attributes Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource">
    <Attribute IncludeInResult="false" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id">
      <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI">http://medico.com/record/patient/BartSimpson</AttributeValue>
    </Attribute>
  </Attributes>
  <Attributes Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action">
    <Attribute IncludeInResult="false" AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id">
      <AttributeValue DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">read</AttributeValue>
    </Attribute>
  </Attributes>
  <Attributes Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:environment" />
</Request>
```

The `<Subject>` element in XACML 2.0 becomes
