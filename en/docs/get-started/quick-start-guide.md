## Workflows

### Problem scenario

After Cameron sets up self registration for Pickup web applications,
Rowan is concerned about the security. Rowan prefers to review and
approve new user accounts before granting access to the Pickup web
applications. Thus, Rowan reaches out to Cameron with these concerns.
Cameron realizes the possibility of creating a workflow using WSO2 Identity Server
and granting role-based authorization, so that each account registration
will be subject to approval.

Let's use the command-line to check out the workflow functionality.

In this workflow, whenever a new user account is created, first it
creates a task for a junior manager (Alex) to approve/reject the account
creation. Upon the junior manager approving the account creation, a task
will be created for the senior manager (Cameron) to approve or reject
the user account.

### Configure a workflow

Follow the steps below to configure a workflow.

!!! tip "Before you begin"
    
    If you have run any other samples in this Quick Start Guide, navigate

    samples.
