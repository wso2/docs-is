# Quick Start Guide

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) is a comprehensive identity and access
management (IAM) solution. It caters to identity management requirements
across many platforms such as enterprise applications, services, and
APIs. This guide gives you a quick walk-through to WSO2 IS using a
sample scenario.

#### Sample Scenario

**Pickup** is a cab company that has many employees who use different
credentials to sign in to different internal enterprise applications.
Following are two such applications:

-   **Pickup Dispatch** : This application helps manage the overall
    operations at Pickup.
-   **Pickup Manager** : This application helps allocate vehicles to
    drivers.

Pickup needs to identify the necessary permission levels to be granted
to the employees and any security vulnerabilities.

**Cameron** is a senior manager at Pickup who is responsible for
resolving these issues using WSO2 IS. **Alex** is a junior manager
attending to day-to-day tasks and **Rowan** is the HR manager.

![qsg-overall-scenario](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-overall-scenario.png)

Let's assume that you are Cameron, and you want to resolve these issues
using WSO2 IS.

### Before you begin
    
1. Download and install Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 1.7.* or 1.8.
2. Install WSO2 IS 5.9.0 by downloading the [installer](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/install/). 
   The WSO2 IS installation location varies according to the OS as given below.

    |OS     |Home Directory                                |
    |:------|:---------------------------------------------|
    |Mac OS | `/Library/WSO2/IdentityServer/5.7.0`         |
    |Windows| `C:\Program Files\WSO2\IdentityServer\5.7.0` |
    |Ubuntu | `/usr/lib/wso2/IdentityServer/5.7.0`         |
    |CentOS | `/usr/lib64/IdentityServer/5.4.70`           |

    For the rest of this guide, the installation location of WSO2 IS is referred to as `<IS_HOME>`.

3. [Download](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and [install](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) Apache Tomcat version 8.*.* or above.
4. [Download](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and install curl.

6. Open the `/etc/hosts` file and add the following entry.        
    
        127.0.0.1        localhost.com    

    !!! note "Notes"
        * If you are planning to use Single Sign-On (SSO), do not use `localhost` as it will cause the Tomcat naked host issue. Use `localhost.com` instead. If you are using Windows, `localhost.com` is considered as `127.0.0.1`.<br/>
        * Make sure that this is the only such entry available for this IP address in the `/etc/hosts` file to avoid any conflicts.

7. [Start](../../setup/running-the-product) WSO2 IS. You are now ready to deploy the sample.

**Steps to configure and run the samples**

1.  Download the samples from [GitHub](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases/tag/v4.1.0) and unzip.

    ``` java
    unzip /home/../is-samples-distribution-4.1.0.zip
    ```

    !!! note
    
        From this point onwards:
    
        -   `               <IS_HOME>              ` is the directory in
            which the WSO2 Identity Server is installed.
        -   `               <TOMCAT_HOME>              ` is the directory in
            which your Apache Tomcat server is installed.
    

2.  Open the server.properties file in `<IS_SAMPLE_DISTR>/IS-QSG/conf/ ` and make sure that wso2is.host.domain and wso2is.host.port are configured as shown below.             
    ```
    #localhost.com is used to resolve naked hostname validation issue
    wso2is.host.domain=localhost.com
    wso2is.host.port=9443
    server.host.domain=localhost.com
    server.host.port=8080
    ```

5.  Navigate to `<IS_HOME>/bin` using the command prompt and start the server.

    ``` java
    Linux   --> sh wso2server.sh
    Windows --> wso2server.bat
    ```
    Note that the following appears in the command prompt after the server start.
    ![qsg-start-server](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-start-server.png)

    !!! tip "Shutting down the server"
        To shutdown the server, press `Ctrl + C`.
        Note that following log appears in the command prompt after the server shutdown.
        ![qsg-stop-server](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-stop-server.png)

6.  Navigate to <IS_SAMPLE_DISTR>/IS-QSG/bin and execute either of the following commands to start the sample application. 
       
     ``` 
         Linux   --> sh app-server.sh
         Windows --> app-server.bat
    ```
8.  Navigate to
    `              is-samples-2.0.0/IS-QSG/samples             ` /
    `              QSG-bundle/QSG/bin             ` and execute either
    of the following commands to start the Quick Start samples.

    ``` java
        Linux   --> sh qsg.sh 
        Windows --> sh qsg.bat 
    ```

    A message appears to pick a scenario, which indicates that the
    samples are deployed and the WSO2 Identity Server is up and running.

9.  When prompted, confirm the configurations.
10. Note that a message appears to pick a scenario, which indicates that
    the samples are deployed and WSO2 IS is up and running.

Let's try out the samples.

### Single Sign-On
##### Problem Scenario

The first problem that Pickup faces is that each employee has to use
separate sets of user names and passwords (credentials) to log in to
Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.

![qsg-sso-scenario](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-scenario.png)

When the number of applications that are used in Pickup increases, the
employees have to maintain more credentials. This is not scalable.
Cameron decides to use Single Sign-On (SSO) to overcome this situation.
With SSO, when a user signs in to one application (authentication), that
user is automatically authenticated to other applications, eliminating
the need to maintain multiple credentials.

Cameron decides to use WSO2 IS to configure SSO.

![qsg-sso-scenario2](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-scenario2.png)

Let's use the command-line to check the SSO functionality with SAML2 or
OIDC.

##### Configuring SSO with SAML2

If the two applications are using SAML2 as their authentication
protocol, follow the steps below:

1.  Enter `               1              ` as the scenario number at the
    command prompt to:

    1.  Create the two users, Cameron and Alex.
    2.  Create and assign the user role Manager to Cameron.
    3.  Create service providers for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.
    4.  Configure SAML2 web SSO for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup
        Manager.  
        ![qsg-configure-sso](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-configure-sso.png)
    5.  Note that a message with the user and web application details
        appears.  
        ![qsg-sso-configure-saml-2](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-configure-saml-2.png)

      

    !!! note
        You can also perform the above using the WSO2 IS Management Console.
        For more information, see [Creating users and
        roles](../../learn/configuring-users-roles-and-permissions), [Configuring service
        providers](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-a-service-provider), and
        [Configuring web app for SSO](../../learn/configuring-single-sign-on).
    

2.  Go to the URL
    <http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com> using
    a web browser to access the Dispatch application.

3.  Click **Log in**.  
    ![qsg-sso-dispatch-login](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-dispatch-login.png)
4.  Enter either of the following credentials to sign in to the
    application.

    ``` java
    Senior Manager --> Username: cameron | Password: cameron123
    Junior Manager --> Username: alex    | Password: alex123
    ```

    ![qsg-sso-login-credentials](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-login-credentials.png)

5.  Select the attributes that you want to share with Dispatch and click
    **Approve**.

    ![qsg-sso-consent](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-consent.png)

    !!! note
    
        Obtaining the user consent is one of the fundamental requirements of
        the GDPR regulation. WSO2 IS facilitates this through its **Consent
        Management** features. To know more about GDPR and how WSO2 IS
        handles consent, see [Consent
        Management](../../learn/consent-management)
        .
    

    Note that the Pickup Dispatch home screen appears.

      

    ![qsg-sso-dispatch-home](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-dispatch-home.png)

6.  Similarly, go to the URL
    <http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-manager.com> Using
    your browser to access the Pickup Manager application.

7.  Click **Log in**.  
    ![qsg-sso-manager-login](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-manager-login.png)

8.  Note that the Pickup Manager application opens without having to
    enter the user credentials again.
    
    ![qsg-sso-manager-home](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-manager-home.png)

9.  To try out other scenarios, navigate back to where you ran the Quick
    Start sample on the command-line and enter
    `              y             ` to clean the setup.  
    ![qsg-sso-cleanup](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-cleanup.png)

##### **Configuring SSO with OIDC**

If the two applications are using OIDC as their authentication protocol,
follow the steps below:

1.  Enter `               2              ` as the scenario number at the
    command prompt.

    1.  Create the two users: Cameron and Alex.
    2.  Create and assign the user role Manager to Cameron.
    3.  Create service providers for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.
    4.  Configure SAML2 web SSO for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.

    ![qsg-configure-sso](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-configure-sso.png)  
    Note that a message with the user and web application details
    appears.

    ![qsg-configure-sso-2](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-configure-sso-2.png)

2.  Enter the
    [http://localhost.com:8080/pickup-dispatch](http://localhost:8080/Dispatch/)
    URL on a web browser to access the Pickup Dispatch application.
3.  Click **Log in**.  
    ![qsg-sso-dispatch-login](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-dispatch-login.png)
4.  Enter either of the following credentials to sign in to the
    application.

    ``` java
    Senior Manager --> Username: cameron | Password: cameron123
    Junior Manager --> Username: alex    | Password: alex123
    ```

    ![qsg-sso-login-credentials](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-login-credentials.png)

5.  Select the approval type that you wish provide and the attributes
    that you wish to share with the application and click **Continue**
    .  
    ![qsg-oidc-consent](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-oidc-consent.png)

    !!! note

        Management** features. To know more about GDPR and how WSO2 IS
        handles consent, see [Consent
        Management](../../learn/consent-management).
    

    Note that the Pickup Dispatch home screen appears.

    ![qsg-sso-dispatch-home](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-dispatch-home.png)

6.  Similarly, enter
    [http://localhost:8080/pickup-manager](http://localhost:8080/Swift/)
    on a browser to access the Pickup Manager application. Notice that
    the Pickup Manager application opens without having to enter the
    user credentials.  
      
    ![qsg-sso-manager-home](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-manager-home.png) 
    You have set up SSO and your employees are happy with their
    experience as they only have to provide credentials once in order to
    access both Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.
7.  Next, in order to try out other scenarios, navigate back to the
    command prompt where you ran the Quick Start sample and enter
    `              y             ` to clean the setup.  
    ![qsg-sso-cleanup](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-sso-cleanup.png)

### Multi-factor Authentication
##### Problem Scenario

Pickup has a secure, hassle-free identity management system in place to
better protect the data resources and applications. However, the
traditional authentication mechanism that uses a user ID and
password is not sufficient. Cameron wants to enhance the security
standards by introducing another level of authentication. As a result,
Cameron decides to use the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) capability
in WSO2 IS using the following factors:

-   **First factor** : password
-   **Second factor** : HARDWARE KEY

Let's use the command-line to check the MFA functionality.

##### Configuring Multi-Factor Authentication

First deploy the sample authenticator dependency and web application in
    WSO2 IS.

   1.  Download the [org.wso2.carbon.identity.sample.extension.authenticators-5.7.0.jar](../../assets/attachments/org.wso2.carbon.identity.sample.extension.authenticators-5.7.0.jar) file and paste inside the
        `              <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins             ` directory.

   2.  Download the [sample-auth.war](../../assets/attachments/sample-auth.war) file and paste it inside the `             <IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps            `
        folder.  
        This `             .war            ` file contains the WEB UI
        for the sample authenticators used in this tutorial.

   3.Add the followings to the deployment.toml in <IS_HOME>/repository/conf
        [[resource.access_control]]
        context = "(.*)/sample-auth/(.*)"
        secure = false
        http_method = "all"  

   And restart the identity server          

Follow the steps below to configure MFA on the Pickup Dispatch and
Pickup Manager applications where HARDWARE KEY is the second authentication
factor.

### Federated Authentication
##### Problem Scenario

Pickup works with a team of external consultants. Cameron wants to grant
them access to the Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager applications.
However, it is a hassle to keep adding and maintaining their accounts in
the employee database as these consultants are temporary and they keep
rotating. Therefore, Cameron decides to use the identity federation
capability of WSO2 IS. This facilitates the external consultants to use
their already existing Google account credentials to sign in to the
Pickup applications.

Let's use the command line utility to check out how an external
consultant uses the command utility to configure federated
authentication.

##### Configuring Federated Authentication

Follow the steps below to configure federated authentication using WSO2
IS:

!!! tip
    
    **Before you begin**
    
    If you have run any other samples in this Quick Start Guide, navigate
    back to the `             is-samples-1.0.0/IS-QSG/samples/QSG-bundle/QSG/bin` on the command prompt and
    execute either of the following commands to start the Quick Start
    samples.
    
    ``` java
    Linux   --> sudo sh qsg.sh run
    Windows --> sudo qsg.bat run
    ```

A message appears to pick a scenario.


1.  Enter `               4              ` as the scenario number at the
    command prompt to:

    1.  Create the two users: Cameron and Alex.
    2.  Create and assign the user role Manager to Cameron.
    3.  Create service providers for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.
    4.  Configure SAML2 web SSO for Pickup Dispatch and Pickup Manager.

    ![qsg-configure-sso](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-configure-sso.png)

2.  Register OAuth 2.0 Application in Google. As the first step, go to
    [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
    and navigate to the **Credentials** tab from the sidebar. You can
    configure OAuth web application in Google by selecting **OAuth
    Client ID** . You can find more details from
    [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect).
      
    ![register-oauth2](../assets/img/tutorials/register-oauth2.png)
      
    Select a web application and give it a name (e.g.,
    SampleWebApllication). Enter the Authorized **redirect URI** as
    `                     https://localhost.com:9443/commonauth                   `
    (this is the endpoint in WSO2 Identity Server that accepts the
    response sent by Google).  
    
3. Note down the `API key` and `secret` for later use.

    ![create-client-id](../assets/img/tutorials/create-client-id.png)

### Self Sign-up
##### Problem Scenario

Pickup is going through a major expansion and is in the process of
hiring new employees. Currently, when a new employee joins, the Pickup
HR team requests for their details, and creates user accounts and then
asks them to verify, edit and customize their user profiles. This
process sometimes takes few days. Thus, the Rowan and the Pickup HR team
is having a hard time doing this one by one for especially when a larger
number of employees come on-board. Cameron realizes that allowing the
new employees to self sign-up to Pickup web applications will speed up
the onboarding process. As a result Cameron sets this up for Pickup HR
using WSO2 IS.

Let's use the command line utility to check out the self sign-up
functionality.

##### Configuring Self-Sign-up

Follow the steps below to configure self sign-up for Pickup Dispatch and
Pickup Manager applications using WSO2 IS.

    A prompt appears to choose the user sign-up approach.

    -   **Enable self user registration (without any config)** : This
        enables self sign-up without having to do additional
        configurations. Once registered, the user receives an email to
        the provided email address.
    -   **Enable account lock on creation** : This locks the user
        account during user registration. The user can only sign in to
        the application after clicking the verification link sent to the
        user-provided email address. A confirmation mail is sent to the
        user but user account is locked until the user confirms the
        account by clicking on the account confirmation mail sent by
        WSO2 IS.

    ![qsg-configure-self-sign-up](../assets/img/getting-started/qsg-configure-self-sign-up.png)

### Workflows
##### Problem Scenario

After Cameron sets up self registration for Pickup web applications,
Rowan is concerned about the security. Rowan prefers to review and
approve new user accounts before granting access to the Pickup web
applications. Thus, Rowan reaches out to Cameron with these concerns.
Cameron realizes the possibility of creating a workflow using WSO2 IS
and granting role-based authorization, so that each account registration
will be subject to approval.

Let's use the command-line to check out the workflow functionality.

In this workflow, whenever a new user account is created, first it
creates a task for a junior manager (Alex) to approve/reject the account
creation. Upon the junior manager approving the account creation, a task
will be created for the senior manager (Cameron) to approve or reject
the user account.

##### Configuring a Workflow

Follow the steps below to configure a workflow.

!!! tip
    
    **Before you begin**

    `             QSG-bundle/QSG/bin            ` on the command prompt and
    execute either of the following commands to start the Quick Start
    samples.
    
    ``` java
