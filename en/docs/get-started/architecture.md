# Architecture

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) is a product built on top of WSO2 Carbon.
Based on the OSGi specification, it enables easy customization and
extension through its componentized architecture. This topic describes
the architecture of the Identity Server. The users are given the choice
of deployment to on-premise servers, private cloud or public cloud
without configuration changes.

WSO2 Identity Server is used directly by multiple users, through its
user-friendly
[Management Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console).
Apart from the default admin user (with the user name ‘admin’), other
users can be created later by the admin users that have the privileges
to create a new user, or by signing up. Each user can have roles, where
each role can have privileges assigned to them. A user’s roles can be
changed at any time by the admin user.

Apart from such registered users, Identity Server is also used as an
identity provider for third party applications, which also have their
own sets of users.

### Architecture and process flow

The following diagram depicts the architecture of the Identity Server
and the various processes that take place within it.

Watch the following video for a quick overview of the process flow of
the Identity Server architecture and how the various components interact
with each other.

### Authentication framework

The following are the authenticator types in the authentication
framework.

#### Inbound authenticators

The responsibility of inbound authenticators is to identify and parse
all the incoming authentication requests and then build the
corresponding response. A given inbound authenticator has two parts.

1.  Request Processor
2.  Response Builder

For each protocol supported by WSO2 Identity Server, there should be an
inbound authenticator. This architecture component includes inbound
authenticators for [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
2.0](http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications), [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/connect/), [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)
, and [WS-Federation
(passive)](http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsfed/federation/v1.2/ws-federation.html)
. In other words, the responsibility of the SAML 2.0 request processor
is to accept a SAML request from a service provider, validate the SAML
request and then build a common object model understood by the
authentication framework and handover the request to it. The
responsibility of the SAML response builder is to accept a common object
model from the authentication framework and build a SAML response out of
it. Both the request processors and the response builders are protocol
aware, while the authentication framework is not coupled to any
protocol.

#### Local authenticators

The responsibility of the local authenticators is to authenticate the
user with locally available credentials. This can be either user name
/password or even [IWA (Integrated Windows
Authentication)](../../learn/integrated-windows-authentication-overview). Local
authenticators are decoupled from the Inbound Authenticators. Once the
initial request is handed over to the authentication framework from an
inbound authenticator, the authentication framework talks to the service
provider configuration component to find the set of local authenticators
registered with the service provider corresponding to the current
authentication request.

Once the local authentication is successfully completed, the local
authenticator will notify the framework. The framework will now decide
no more authentication is needed and hand over the control to the
corresponding response builder of the inbound authenticator.

You can develop your own local authenticators and plug them into the
Identity Server.

#### Outbound/federated authenticators

The responsibility of the federated authenticators is to authenticate
the user with an external system. This can be with Facebook, Google,
Yahoo, LinkedIn, Twitter, Salesforce or any other identity provider.
Federated authenticators are decoupled from the Inbound Authenticators.
Once the initial request is handed over to the authentication framework
from an inbound authenticator, the authentication framework talks to the
service provider configuration component to find the set of federated
authenticators registered with the service provider corresponding to the
current authentication request.

A federated authenticator has no value unless it is associated with an
identity provider. The Identity Server out-of-the-box supports Security
Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and
WS-Federation (passive). The SAML 2 .0 federated authenticator itself
has no value. It has to be associated with an Identity Provider. Google
Apps can be an identity provider - with the SAML 2.0 federated
authenticator. This federated authenticator knows how to generate a SAML
request to the Google Apps and process a SAML response from it.

There are two parts in a federated authenticator.

1.  Request Builder
2.  Response Processor

Once the federation authentication is successfully completed, the
federated authenticator will notify the authentication framework. The
framework will now decide no more authentication is needed and hand over
the control to the corresponding response builder of the inbound
authenticator.

Both the request builder and the response processor are protocol aware
while the authentication framework is not coupled to any protocol.

You can develop your own federated authenticators and plug them into the
Identity Server.

#### Multi-option authenticators

The service provider can define how to authenticate users at the
Identity Server, for authentication requests initiated by it. While
doing that, each service provider can pick more than one authenticator
to allow end users to get multiple login options. This can be a
combination of local authenticators and federated authenticators.

#### Multi-factor authenticators

The service provider can define how to authenticate users at the
Identity Server, for authentication requests initiated by it. While
doing that, each service provider can define multiple steps and for each
step it can pick more than one authenticator. The authentication
framework tracks all the authenticators in each step and proceeds to the
next step only if the user authenticates successfully in the current
step. It is an AND between steps, while it is an OR between the
authenticators in a given step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Provisioning framework

The following are the provisioning components available in the
provisioning framework.

#### Inbound provisioning

Inbound provisioning focuses on how to provision users to the Identity
Server. Out-of-the-box, the Identity Server supports inbound
provisioning via a Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP) based API as
well as the System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM) 1.1 API.
Both the APIs support HTTP Basic Authentication. If you invoke the
provisioning API with Basic Authentication credentials, then where to
provision the user (to which user store) will be decided based on the
inbound provisioning configuration of the resident service provider.

The SCIM API also supports OAuth 2.0. If the user authenticates to the
SCIM API with OAuth credentials, then the system will load the
configuration corresponding to the service provider who owns the OAuth
client id. If you plan to invoke the SCIM API via a web application or a
mobile application, we would highly recommend you to use OAuth instead
of Basic Authentication. You simply need to register your application as
a service provider in Identity Server and then generate OAuth keys.

#### Just-in-time provisioning

Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning talks about how to provision users to
the Identity Server at the time of federated authentication. A service
provider initiates the authentication request, the user gets redirected
to the Identity Server and then Identity Server redirects the user to an
external identity provider for authentication. Just-in-time provisioning
gets triggered in such a scenario when the Identity Server receives a
positive authentication response from the external identity provider.
The Identity Server will provision the user to its internal user store
with the user claims from the authentication response.

You configure JIT provisioning against an identity provider - not
against service providers. Whenever you associate an identity provider
with a service provider for outbound authentication, if the JIT
provisioning is enabled for that particular identity provider, then the
users from the external identity provider will be provisioned into the
Identity Server's internal user store. In the JIT provisioning
configuration you can also pick the provisioning user store.

JIT provisioning happens while in the middle of an authentication flow.
The provisioning can happen in a blocking mode or in a non-blocking
mode. In the blocking mode, the authentication flow will be blocked till
the provisioning finishes - while in the non-blocking mode, provisioning
happens in a different thread.

#### Outbound provisioning

Outbound provisioning talks about provisioning users to external
systems. This can be initiated by any of the following.

-   Inbound provisioning request (initiated by a service provider or the
    resident service provider)
-   JIT provisioning (initiated by a service provider)
-   Adding a user via the management console (initiated by the resident
    service provider)
-   Assigning a user to a provisioning role (initiated by the resident
    service provider)

WSO2 Identity Server supports outbound provisioning with the following
connectors. You need to configure one or more outbound provisioning
connectors with a given identity provider, and associate the identity
provider with a service provider. All the provisioning requests must be
initiated by a service provider - and will be provisioned to all the
identity providers configured in the outbound provisioning configuration
of the corresponding service provider.

-   SCIM
-   SPML
-   SOAP
-   Google Apps provisioning API
-   Salesforce provisioning API

<p>A Service Provider (SP) is an entity that provides Web services. A service provider relies on a trusted Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication and authorization. In this case, the Identity Server acts as the IdP and does the task of authenticating and authorizing the user of the service provider.</p>
<p>Salesforce and Google Apps are examples of service providers and are used as such in this case.</p>

<li><strong>OAuth/OpenID Connect</strong> : OAuth 2.0 has three main phases. They are; requesting an Authorization Grant, exchanging the Authorization Grant for an Access Token and accessing the resources using this Access Token. OpenID Connect is another identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0. OAuth applications can get authentication event information over the ID token and can get the extra claims of the authenticated user from the OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint. WSO2 IS supports Oauth 1.0 and 2.0.</li>
<li><strong>Passive STS</strong> : A Security Token Service (STS) is a software based identity provider responsible for issuing security tokens, especially software tokens, as part of a claims-based identity system. <strong><br />

<p>Claim management is a key aspect of the Identity Server, which helps to map local claims to service provider claims and vice versa. It also enables you to map local claims to identity provider claims and vice versa.</p>
<p>Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning allows you to create users on the fly without having to create user accounts in advance. For example, if you recently added a user to your application, you don't need to manually create the user in the Identity Server. When they log in with single sign-on, their account is automatically created for them, eliminating the time and effort related to creating the account. Just-in-Time provisioning works with your identity provider to pass the correct user information to the Identity Server.</p>

<p>A claim is a piece of information about a particular subject. It can be anything that the subject is owned by or associated with, such as name, group, preferences, etc. A claim provides a single and general notion to define the identity information related to the subject. Claim-based identity is a common way for any application to acquire the identity information. It provides a consistent approach for all applications by hiding the lower level implementation. Claims are also used in identity propagation, by packaging the claims into one or more tokens (such as SAML). These tokens are then issued by an issuer; commonly known as a security token service (STS).</p>

<p>eXtensible Access Control Markup Language ( XACML) is ideally a part of the authorization manager component but it is depicted separately due to its unique role in the Identity Server architecture. XACML is an XML-based language for access control that has been standardized by the Technical Committee of the OASIS consortium. XACML is popular as a fine grain authorization method among the community. However, there are aspects of XACML that enable it to surpass being just a fine grain authorization mechanism. XACML describes access control policy language, request/response language and reference architecture. The policy language is used to express access control policies (who can do what when). The request/response language expresses queries about whether a particular access should be allowed (requests) and describes answers to those queries(responses).</p>

<p>Enterprise IT Systems are constantly changing; their perimeters are expanding and their policies keep changing. Therefore, in such a rapidly evolving world, security solutions need to be forward thinking and innovative. They need to be configurable in order to keep pace and adapt to rapid changes. This can be achieved by the identity manager component because it caters to security requirements at hand as well as looking toward the future. It has a very customizable user interface and can be easily implemented in order to ensure maximum security for your system.</p>
