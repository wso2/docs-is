# Identity Anti-patterns and the Identity Bus

This topic explores the problem of identity anti-patterns and the
solution provided by the WSO2 Identity Server in the form of the
identity bus.

### Spaghetti identity and federation silos

According to research conducted by the analyst firm,
[Quocirca](http://quocirca.com/), many businesses now have more
external users than internal ones. Also many businesses are involved in
acquisitions, mergers and partnerships, and these result in lots of
external users joining the business. Often, these external users have to
be integrated with the existing user base in bulk. This sort of
integration can be complicated due to the different protocols followed
by different identity systems.

#### How this impacts enterprise identity management

When working with both external and internal users and merging different
systems together, you are faced with technicalities related to
management of multiple heterogeneous user stores, different types of
authentication protocols, legacy systems and many more.

SAML, OpenID Connect, and WS-Federation all support identity federation
and cross domain authentication. However, in a real world scenario, not
all involved parties in a federation use case will support SAML and
OpenID Connect. Most of the federation systems seen today are in silos.
It can be a silo of SAML federation or a silo of OpenID Connect
federation. While a system that uses SAML as it's protocol may be able
to communicate with other SAML protocol-based systems, they may not be
able to communicate with OpenID Connect.

The diagram below illustrates how a silo of SAML federation and OpenID
Connect federation interact within the respective silo and how it cannot
interact with different silos.

Also consider the scalability of a specific federation silo. Within the
SAML federation silo, for example, there can be an increasing number of
service providers and identity providers. Each service provider has to
trust each identity provider and this leads to the Spaghetti Identity
anti-pattern. The following diagram depicts the complexity of this.

### The identity bus

Federation Silos and Spaghetti Identity are two anti-patterns directly
addressed by the Identity Bus pattern in the WSO2 Identity Server. With
Identity Bus, a given service provider is not coupled to a given
identity provider and also not coupled to a given federation protocol. A
user should be able to log into a service provider that accepts only
SAML 2.0 tokens with an identity provider that issues only OpenID
Connect tokens. The Identity Bus acts as a middle-man, or an Identity
Broker, that mediates and transforms identity tokens between
heterogeneous identity protocols.

The following are some of the benefits of using the Identity Bus
pattern.

1.  **Introducing a new service provider is extremely easy.** You only
    need to register the service provider in the Identity Bus and pick
    which identity providers it trusts. It is not necessary to add the
    service provider configuration to each and every identity
    provider. Similarly, removing an existing service provider is
    extremely easy. You only need to remove the service provider from
    the Identity Bus. It is not necessary to remove the service provider
    from each and every identity provider.
2.  **Introducing a new identity provider is extremely easy.** You only
    need to register the identity provider in the Identity Bus. It will
    be available for any service provider. Similarly, removing an
    existing identity provider is extremely easy. You only need to
    remove the identity provider from the Identity Bus.
3.  **Enforcing new authentication protocols is extremely easy.**
    Consider a scenario where you need to authenticate users with both
    the username and password and also Duo Security (SMS based
    authentication). To do this, you only need to add that capability to
    the Identity Bus and pick the required set of authentication
    protocols against a given service provider at the time of service
    provider registration. In the Identity Bus, each service provider
    can be configured based on how it authenticates users.
4.  **Claim transformations.** Your service provider may read user's
    email address from the "http://sp1.org/claims/email" attribute
    id - but the identity provider of the user may send it as "
    http://idp1.org/claims/emai". Identity bus can transform the
    claims it receives from the identity provider to the format expected
    by the service provider.
5.  **Role mapping.** Your service provider needs to authorize users
    once they are logged in. What the user can do at the identity
    provider is different from what the same user can do at the service
    provider. User's roles from the identity provider define what he can
    do at the identity provider. Service provider's roles define the
    things a user can do at the service provider. Identity bus is
    capable of mapping identity provider's roles to the service
    provider's roles. For example a user may bring idp-admin role from
    his identity provider - in a SAML response - then the identity bus
    will find the mapped service provider role corresponding to this,
    say sp-admin, and will add that into the SAML response returning
    back to the service provider from the identity bus.
6.  **Just-in-time provisioning.** Since identity bus is at the middle
    of all identity transactions - it can provision all external user
    identities to an internal user store.
7.  **Centralized monitoring and auditing.**
8.  **Introducing a new federation protocol needs minimal changes.** If
    you have a service provider or an identity provider, which supports
    a proprietary federation protocol, then you only need to add that
    capability to the identity bus. No need to implement it at each and
    every identity provider or service provider.
