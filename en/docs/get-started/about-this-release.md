**WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0** is the **latest WSO2 Identity Server release** and is the successor of **WSO2 Identity Server 5.8.0**. It contains the following new features and enhancements:


- 	**Passwordless authentication**: This feature is supported using the FIDO2 protocol. For more information, see [Configuring Passwordless Authentication](../../learn/configuring-passwordless-authentication).
