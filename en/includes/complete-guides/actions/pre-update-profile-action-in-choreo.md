## Using Choreo

In this section, we will walk through how to implement and deploy the Pre-Update Profile Action using Choreo based on
the scenario discussed earlier.

This implementation is done using Node.js and follows the logic of validating user department updates and notifying the
security team when sensitive user attributes are changed.

### Set Up Your Node.js Project

Create a new project folder on your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory where
your project files will be stored. You can do this by running:

```bash
mkdir profile-update-validator
```

This command creates a new folder named `profile-update-validator`. Then, move inside that folder by running:

```bash
cd profile-update-validator
```

Now, any new files or commands you use will be applied inside this project folder. Once you're inside the folder, run:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a file named `package.json` automatically. The `package.json` file is very important, it keeps track of
your project details (like name, version, and dependencies) and will help others (or platforms like Choreo) understand
how to run your project.

The `-y` flag automatically fills in default values for you, so you don’t need to answer any setup questions manually.

Install required dependencies. We will use express for building the service, nodemailer for sending emails, and dotenv 
to read environment variables. 

Still inside your project folder, install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
npm install express nodemailer dotenv
```

express: A fast, lightweight framework that makes building web servers in Node.js very simple and structured.

nodemailer: A library that makes it easy to send emails from your application.

dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, helping you
manage configuration settings securely and cleanly.

This command will download the libraries and save them inside a folder called `node_modules` and also update your
package.json file under `dependencies`, showing that your project uses these libraries.

Create a file named index.js and add the following basic structure: In your project folder, create a new file called
index.js. (You can right-click and choose “New File” if using a code editor like VS Code, or create it via terminal
using the command `touch index.js`.)

```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
require("dotenv").config();

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());
```

After saving this file, you will have a basic server ready that you can expand by adding routes (like
`/validate-user-profile-update`) in the next steps.

### Implement the Profile Update Validation Logic

Add a helper function that looks through the incoming user data (claims) and picks out specific information like
department, email, or phone number based on the provided field name.

```JavaScript
// Helper to extract claim values
const getClaimValue = (claims, uri) => {
    const claim = claims.find(c => c.uri === uri);
    return claim ? claim.value : null;
};
```

Create a list of departments that are considered valid for your organization. Also, set up an email service (using
Nodemailer) to send notifications when sensitive user profile updates happen. We will use a service like Mailtrap for
development testing.

```JavaScript
// Mock: valid department list (simulating a directory check)
const validDepartments = ["Engineering", "HR", "Sales", "Finance"];

// Email transporter config
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: "sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io", // The hostname should be smtp.gmail.com if Gmail is used.
    port: 2525, // The port should be 465 smtp.gmail.com if Gmail is used.
    auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
        pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
    }
});
```

Implement the `/validate-user-profile-update` API endpoint by creating a POST API that listens for user profile update
requests from {{product_name}}.

Inside this API:

* Check if the request is for a profile update.
* Extract the user’s department, email, and phone details from the request.
* Validate if the department is within the allowed list.
* If sensitive fields are being updated, send an email notification to the security team.
* Send a success or failure response back depending on the validation and email sending outcome.

```JavaScript
app.post("/validate-user-profile-update", async (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;

    if (payload.actionType !== "PRE_UPDATE_PROFILE") {
        return res.status(200).json({
            actionStatus: "FAILED",
            failureReason: "invalid_input",
            failureDescription: "Invalid actionType provided."
        });
    }

    const claims = payload?.event?.request?.claims || [];
    const userId = payload?.event?.user?.id || "Unknown User";

    const department = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/department");
    const email = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress");
    const phone = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile");

    // Department validation
    if (department && !validDepartments.includes(department)) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            actionStatus: "FAILED",
            failureReason: "invalid_department_input",
            failureDescription: "Provided user department value is invalid."
        });
    }

    // Send security alert email if sensitive attributes are being updated
    const changes = [];
    if (department) changes.push(`Department: ${department}`);
    if (email) changes.push(`Email: ${email}`);
    if (phone) changes.push(`Phone: ${phone}`);

    if (changes.length > 0) {
        try {
            await transporter.sendMail({
                from: '"Security Alert" <security-notifications@test.com>',
                to: "security-team@test.com", // Replace with actual security email
                subject: "Sensitive Attribute Update Request",
                text: `User ${userId} is attempting to update:\n\n${changes.join("\n")}`
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Failed to send security email:", error);
            return res.status(200).json({
                actionStatus: "FAILED",
                failureReason: "email_error",
                failureDescription: "Failed to notify security team about sensitive data update."
            });
        }
    }

    // All validations passed
    return res.status(200).json({actionStatus: "SUCCESS"});
});
```

The final source code should look similar to the following.

```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
require("dotenv").config();

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Root endpoint
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return res.status(200).json({"status": "ok", "message": "Service is running."});
});

// Mock: valid department list (simulating a directory check)
const validDepartments = ["Engineering", "HR", "Sales", "Finance"];

// Email transporter config
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: "sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io",
    port: 2525,
    auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
        pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
    }
});

// Helper to extract claim values
const getClaimValue = (claims, uri) => {
    const claim = claims.find(c => c.uri === uri);
    return claim ? claim.value : null;
};

app.post("/validate-user-profile-update", async (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;

    if (payload.actionType !== "PRE_UPDATE_PROFILE") {
        return res.status(200).json({
            actionStatus: "FAILED",
            failureReason: "invalid_input",
            failureDescription: "Invalid actionType provided."
        });
    }

    const claims = payload?.event?.request?.claims || [];
    const userId = payload?.event?.user?.id || "Unknown User";

    const department = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/department");
    const email = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress");
    const phone = getClaimValue(claims, "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile");

    // Department validation
    if (department && !validDepartments.includes(department)) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            actionStatus: "FAILED",
            failureReason: "invalid_department_input",
            failureDescription: "Provided user department value is invalid."
        });
    }

    // Send security alert email if sensitive attributes are being updated
    const changes = [];
    if (department) changes.push(`Department: ${department}`);
    if (email) changes.push(`Email: ${email}`);
    if (phone) changes.push(`Phone: ${phone}`);

    if (changes.length > 0) {
        try {
            await transporter.sendMail({
                from: '"Security Alert" <security-notifications@test.com>',
                to: "security-team@test.com", // Replace with actual security email
                subject: "Sensitive Attribute Update Request",
                text: `User ${userId} is attempting to update:\n\n${changes.join("\n")}`
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Failed to send security email:", error);
            return res.status(200).json({
                actionStatus: "FAILED",
                failureReason: "email_error",
                failureDescription: "Failed to notify security team about sensitive data update."
            });
        }
    }

    // All validations passed
    return res.status(200).json({actionStatus: "SUCCESS"});
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

```

### Prepare for Choreo Deployment

Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information by adding a new file named `.env` in your project folder. The file 
is primarily used for local testing, but these are included separately in the Choreo deployment.

```bash
touch .env
```

In this file, save your email service login details (like username and password) securely, instead of putting them
directly in your code.

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-smtp-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-smtp-password
```

#### Run an Express Node Project Locally

Navigate to the root of your project and install all required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the Express server using:

```bash
node index.js
```

Or, if a custom script is defined (e.g., dev), run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, and your API will be accessible on:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/<endpoint-name>
```

If you're using tools like nodemon for auto-reloading during development, make sure it's installed and used in the dev
script.

### Push Your Code to GitHub

First, initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

```bash
git init
```

Then, add all your project files to the Git repository. Make sure not to commit files containing sensitive information
or unnecessary files, you can use the `.gitignore` file to exclude them.

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit for Choreo deployment"
```

Finally, link your local Git repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub) and push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
git push -u origin master
```

This makes your code available in the cloud and allows easy collaboration or version control.

### Deploy on Choreo

Log in to your Choreo Console and create a new project by signing in to your Choreo account and creating a new project
from the dashboard.

![Create Choreo Project]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image2.png)

Within the created project, go to the "Components" section and create a new component. Select 'API Service' as the
component type.

Link your GitHub account and select the profile-update-validator repository that contains your code. Choreo will use
this to build the project.

![Create Choreo Service]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image23.png)

After the build is complete, navigate to the "Deploy" tab, click 'Configure and Deploy', and provide values for any
required environment variables (like email credentials) so that they will be available during execution.

![Setup Choreo Environment_Variables]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image24.png)

For security, make sure to enable the API Key protection mechanism. This will ensure that only authorized users can
access your API.

![Add Choreo API Key Protection]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image5.png)

After the deployment is complete, Choreo will provide a 'Public URL' for your API under **Endpoints > 
Endpoint Details**. Be sure to copy this URL for future reference.

Additionally, Go to **Manage > Lifecycle** and click 'Publish' to move your API from the "Created" state to the 
"Published" state.

![Choreo API Lifecycle Update]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image6.png)

Once the API is published, navigate to the Dev portal (via the "Go to Devportal" link in the top right corner). In the
Dev portal, go to **Credentials > Sandbox** and generate a new API key. This key is required for accessing the API 
securely.

![Create Choreo API Key]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/actions/image7.png)

The API key will be generated along with an application in Asgardeo. Copy and save the key securely for later use in
your API calls.

### Test Deployed Service

To test the deployed service, you will need the public URL and the API key. A sample request for a successful scenario
is shown below.

```cURL
curl --location '<public_url>/validate-user-profile-update' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: <api_key>' \
--data-raw '{
    "actionType": "PRE_UPDATE_PROFILE",
    "event": {
        "request": {
            "claims": [
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/department",
                    "value": "HR"
                },
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/mobile",
                    "value": "+94771223448"
                },
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress",
                    "value": "testuser@wso2.com"
                }
            ]
        },
        "tenant": {
            "id": "2210",
            "name": "testwso2"
        },
        "user": {
            "id": "57b22cbf-4688-476c-a607-c0c9d089d25d",
            "claims": [
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/username",
                    "value": "testuser@wso2.com"
                },
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/userSource",
                    "value": "DEFAULT"
                },
                {
                    "uri": "http://wso2.org/claims/identity/idpType",
                    "value": "Local"
                }
            ]
        },
        "userStore": {
            "id": "REVGQVVMVA==",
            "name": "DEFAULT"
        },
        "initiatorType": "ADMIN",
        "action": "UPDATE"
    }
}'
```

### Configure {{product_name}} for Pre-Update Profile Action Workflow

First, sign in to your {{product_name}} account using your admin credentials, click on "Actions" and then select the
action type Pre Update Profile.

Add an action name, the endpoint extracted from the deployment, and the appropriate authentication mechanism. For
Choreo, append the endpoint name defined in the source code to the generated Choreo URL, and set the authentication
mechanism to use an API key with the header name `api-key` and the value generated through the Dev Portal.
