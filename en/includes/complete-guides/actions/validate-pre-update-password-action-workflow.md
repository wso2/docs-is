To test the scenario, update the user's password with passwords that are compromised and not compromised
through [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). You can perform this update either through the 
Console (administrator update) or the My Account application (self-update) to verify that the only none compromised 
passwords are allowed to be set.

#### Console (administrator update)

Log in to the Console application using the administrator account, navigate to **User Management > Users**, click on a
specific user, and reset the password.

#### My Account (self-update)

Log in to the My Account application using a specific user, navigate to **Security > Change Password**, and update the 
password.
