## Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites

These prerequisites will help you to successfully complete the hands-on exercises and deployment steps in this guide:

* Approximately 120 minutes to complete all the examples and deployments.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager){:target="_blank"} v22.0+ and npm installed on your machine.
* An active {{product_name}} account to configure and test your service extensions.
* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}
  and [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line){:target="_blank"} to manage and deploy
  your code repositories.
* A favorite text editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or any editor you are comfortable with).
* An SMTP server is required for scenarios involving email sending. For this, we will
  use [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/register/signup?ref=header){:target="_blank"}. Once your account is created, you
  will find the SMTP credentials under **My Inbox > Integration > SMTP**. If Gmail SMTP is used, you can follow the
  steps mentioned in the [Google Support article](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en){:target="_blank"}
  to set up the SMTP server.
* An [AbuseIPDB account](https://www.abuseipdb.com/register?plan=free){:target="_blank"} with an API key is required to
  check for abusive IP addresses in real time.

You will also need the following accounts to deploy and test the sample services:

* An active [Choreo account](https://choreo.dev/){:target="_blank"} for deploying sample services.
* A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup){:target="_blank"} for cloud-hosting sample services.
* An [AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register){:target="_blank"} with console access to
  deploy and manage AWS Lambda functions.

Make sure all the accounts and tools are set up beforehand to ensure a smooth learning experience.
