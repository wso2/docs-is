To test the scenario, update the user's profile with sensitive claim values such as department, email, and phone number.
You can perform this update either through the Console (administrator update) or the My Account application (
self-update) to verify that the department validation is working and that an email is sent via the SMTP server.
Additionally, test with invalid department values to ensure the implementation handles errors as expected.
