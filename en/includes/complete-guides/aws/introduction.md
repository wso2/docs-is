# Deploying WSO2 Identity Server on AWS

Are you an enterprise architect, DevOps engineer, or system administrator looking to deploy a robust, scalable identity and access management solution in the cloud? Implementing a production-ready Identity Server requires careful planning, proper infrastructure design, and adherence to security best practices.

Modern enterprises demand identity solutions that handle thousands of concurrent users while maintaining high availability and security standards. This comprehensive guide walks you through deploying WSO2 Identity Server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We leverage cloud-native services and architectural patterns to create an enterprise-grade identity management platform.

This deployment architecture uses multiple WSO2 Identity Server nodes in a clustered configuration. The nodes connect to a managed MySQL RDS database for high availability and automatic failover.

Distributing authentication and authorization workloads across multiple instances behind a load balancer ensures optimal performance. The system maintains service continuity even during peak traffic or node failures.
