# Pre-issue access token action

The pre-issue access token action in {{product_name}} allows you to execute custom logic before issuing an access token. This action is triggered during the OAuth2 token issuance process, enabling you to modify the access token or implement additional checks before the token is issued.

You can use this functionality to:

- Add, modify, or remove scopes.
- Add, modify, or remove audience values.
- Modify or remove [OIDC scopes]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/manage-scopes/) incorporated into the access token.
- Add custom claims (only string, number, boolean, and string type arrays are allowed).
- Update the validity period of the access token.

Once an access token is modified, the changes are persisted as transactional data (for the period access token is active, until it is purged from the underlying data store). In subsequent flows, the modified access token is made available to applications, resource servers, and any actions engaged in later flows. For example, if an access token is modified during the authorization code flow, the same modified access token is used in the refresh token flow.

!!! note
    Currently, this action can only be applied at the root organization level and is available exclusively for JWT tokens. It supports the following grant types: authorization code, client credentials, password, and refresh token.

## How pre-issue access token action works

When a pre-issue access token action is configured with your external service endpoint, {{product_name}} will call your service and wait for a response whenever a token request is received. Upon receiving the response, {{product_name}} will apply any modifications to the access token as specified in the response and then continue with the flow.

The [pre-issue access token API contract]({{base_path}}/references/actions/pre-issue-access-token-action/api-contract/) defines the request and response structures that your service must implement.

#### allowedOperations
<a name="allowed-operations"></a>

The allowedOperations property in the context of the pre-issue access token action defines the set of operations that your external service is permitted to perform on the access token's claims and scopes. This property is specifically related to the <code>event.accessToken</code> property and outlines which attributes can have additional properties added, values replaced, or be removed. The <code>allowedOperations</code> are defined using JSON Patch modification semantics.

In the context of the pre-issue access token action, certain claims related to authorization decisions, such as audience (aud), access token validity (expires_in), and scopes (scopes), are allowed to be modified. These claims are typically associated with the resource server and influence how access is granted.

However, other standard access token claims, such as the issuer (iss) and token bindings (binding_type), represent the authorization server and are critical for authorization decisions. As such, these properties are not available for modification through the action. Instead, application and organization-level configurations should be used to change these properties and their associated behaviors.

Additionally, any OIDC claims incorporated into the access token are also allowed to be modified.

Here is the example of an allowedOperations object in a request formatted as a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "allowedOperations": [
    {
      "op": "add",
      "paths": [
        "/accessToken/claims/",
        "/accessToken/scopes/",
        "/accessToken/claims/aud/"
      ]
    },
    {
      "op": "remove",
      "paths": ["/accessToken/scopes/", "/accessToken/claims/aud/"]
    },
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "paths": [
        "/accessToken/scopes/",
        "/accessToken/claims/aud/",
        "/accessToken/claims/expires_in"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Response from External Service:

When {{product_name}} invokes your external service as part of the pre-issue access token action, it expects a response that adheres to the defined [API contract]({{base_path}}/references/actions/pre-issue-access-token-action/api-contract/) here.

This response plays a crucial role in determining how the access token is ultimately issued or modified. Here’s a breakdown of the expected response:

The response can have two possible states: <code>SUCCESS</code> and <code>ERROR</code>.

<code>SUCCESS</code>: Indicates that the request was processed successfully and includes any state changes or modifications that should be applied.

<code>ERROR</code>: Indicates a failure in processing, accompanied by an error message that should be communicated to the application. This error message should adhere to OAuth 2.0 error response definitions to ensure compliance. However, it is your responsibility to ensure this compliance when extending the flow.

!!! note
    Currently, <code>ERROR</code> responses are not communicated back to the client, but this functionality is planned for inclusion by September 2024.

#### Response for SUCCESS state:

When the external service responds with a 200 status code and a <code>SUCCESS</code> state, it indicates that the request was processed correctly and that any requested modifications to the access token or associated data have been completed. The response should include details about these modifications, typically in the form of an <code>operations</code> object that outlines the changes made to the token's claims, scopes, or other relevant attributes.

Http Status Code: 200

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

!!! tip
    Refer the [sample responses for successful access token updates]({{base_path}}/references/actions/pre-issue-access-token-action/sample-success-responses/) to learn how to construct success responses for different scenarios.

#### Response for ERROR state:

When the external service responds with an <code>ERROR</code> state, it can return an HTTP status code of 400, 401, or 500, indicating that the expected validations are not met or there is an issue processing the request.

Http Status Code: 400, 401 or 500

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>actionStatus</td>
<td><p>Indicates the outcome of the request. For an error operation, this should be set to <code>ERROR</code>.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>error</td>
<td><p>The error code, as specified in OAuth 2.0 error response definitions.</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>errorDescription</td>
<td><p>A detailed description of the error.</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

!!! note
    Currently, <code>ERROR</code> responses are not communicated back to the client, but this functionality is planned for inclusion by September 2024.

If the defined error response is not received, or if the external service fails to respond, this is identified as an error in executing the action. In such cases, the flow will proceed as if the action was not applied, ensuring that the process continues without disruption.
