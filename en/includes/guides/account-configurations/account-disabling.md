# Enable account disabling

When a user leaves your organization or stays inactive for a long period, you might want to disable their account instead of deleting it permanently. Disabling a user account prevents the user from logging into applications or to the self-service My Account portal, while retaining their information and activity history.

!!! note

    Account disabling serves as a long-term, permanent solution. If you only want to temporarily lock user accounts, use account locking instead. See [lock users]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/#lock-a-user-account) for more details.

By default, the {{product_name}} Console keeps the account disabling feature turned off in user profiles. To enable account disabling in user profiles,

1. On the {{product_name}} Console, go to **Login and Registration**.

2. Under **Account Management**, click **Account Disable**.

3. Toggle **Enable account disabling** on to enable.

Once enabled, every user profile displays an option to disable the user. Learn more about user profiles in [manage users]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/).
