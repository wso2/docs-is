# Manage roles

A role is a collection of permissions, also represented as a scope. It is a convenient way of managing permissions as roles facilitate the addition, removal and updating of permissions collectively, rather than individually managing permissions for each user. Roles play a crucial role in controlling access to APIs and applications.

In {{product_name}}, developers can define two types of roles based on the audience.

- **Application level** - Roles tailored to the the specific requirements of an application.

- **Organization level** - For scenarios involving multiple applications sharing common login, registration, and authorization requirements. For example, omnichannel applications with both web and mobile components where there is a requirement to use the same set of roles across multiple applications.

You can assign users and groups to one or many roles. When a group is assigned to a role, all group members inherit the permissions of the role.

!!! note
    {{product_name}} facilitates sending application role information of a user as a user attribute in authentication responses such as JWT tokens and ID tokens. Learn more about [OIDC flows]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/oidc/).

## Create a role

To create a role and assign permissions to it:

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **User Management** > **Roles**.

    !!! warning
        Selected role audience cannot be modified later.

        Applications can be configured to consume either application or organization roles. Learn how to [associate roles to an application](#associate-roles-to-an-application).

## Associate roles to an application

Roles created for an **Application** audience are only associated with the selected application. {{product_name}} also allows you to associate organization roles to an application.

!!! warning "Before you proceed"
    If you have previously associated application roles to an application, switching the audience to `organization`, permanently deletes the application roles associated to the application.

Roles created for an **Organization** audience do not need to be associated with any specific applications. They serve a broader organizational purpose and are available throughout the organization.

!!! note
    When an application with **Organization** audience is shared with a Business-to-Business (B2B) organization, all the Organization roles available in the root organization will be shared with that B2B organization.
