# Add login with an OpenID Connect identity provider

You can add standard OpenID Connect login <!-- [OpenID Connect login](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#)--> to your applications using an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP) and enable users to log in to your applications while maintaining their accounts in the external identity providers.

Follow this guide to register an OIDC IdP in {{ product_name }} and add it to the login flow of your application.

## Register {{ product_name }} in the IdP

You need to register an OpenID Connect application with the external identity provider. Follow the identity provider's documentation to know how to register an OIDC application.

You can use the following URL as the **Authorized redirect URL** (also known as callback URL) of the application.

```bash 
{{ product_url_format }}/commonauth
```

!!!note 
    To configure an Identity Server instance as the external identity provider, see [register an OpenID Connect web app]({{base_path}}guides/applications/register-oidc-web-app)

Once you register an application, you will receive the following:

- **client_id** (also known as `app_id` or `application_id`)
- **client_secret** (also known as `app_secret`)

Check the documentation of the OIDC identity provider and get the following endpoints:

- Authorization Endpoint URL
- Token Endpoint URL
- User Info endpoint (optional)
- Logout endpoint (optional)

## Register the OIDC IdP

Now, let's register the OIDC IdP in {{ product_name }}.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, click **Connections**.
2. Click **Create Connection** and select **Standard-Based IdP**.
3. Provide a unique **identity provider name**, select **OpenID Connect**, and click **Next**.

    ![Create OIDC Enterprise IDP in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/oidc-enterprise-idp/create-oidc-enterprise-idp-wizard.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Enter the following details of the external OIDC identity provider and click **Next**:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Client ID</td>
            <td>The client ID obtained from the external identity provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Client secret</td>
            <td>The client secret obtained from the external identity provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Authorization endpoint URL</td>
            <td>The authorization endpoint of the external identity provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Token endpoint URL</td>
            <td>The token endpoint of the external identity provider.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

5. (Optional) Provide the mode of certificate configuration.

    !!! note
        You can either configure a JWKS endpoint or upload a certificate of the external party. This helps to validate the signature of the assertions sent by the external identity provider.

    - **JWKS endpoint**: The JWKS endpoint of the external identity provider.
    - **Use PEM certificate**: Upload or paste the public certificate of the external identity provider. The certificate should be in PEM format.

        ??? note "If you have a certificate in other formats such as `.crt`, `.cer` or `.der`, expand here to see how you can convert them to PEM format using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)"
            **Convert CRT to PEM**
            ```bash
            openssl x509 -in cert.crt -out cert.pem

            ```
            **Convert CER to PEM:**
            ```bash
            openssl x509 -in cert.cer -out cert.pem
            ```  

            **Convert DER to PEM:**
            ```bash
            openssl x509 -in cert.der -out cert.pem
            ```

6. Click **Finish** to complete the registration.

!!! note
    Once the OIDC identity provider is created, you can configure [additional OIDC settings]({{base_path}}/references/idp-settings/oidc-settings-for-idp/#additional-settings) from the **Settings** tab.

{{ product_name }} requests for the **openid** scope from the external identity provider. If you need more attributes from the external identity provider, you can configure scopes from the **Settings** tab.

## Enable the OIDC IdP for login

!!! note "Before you begin"
    You need to [register an application with {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/). You can register your own application or use one of the [sample applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-samples/) provided.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Applications**.

2. Select your application, go to the **Sign-in Method** tab and add OIDC identity provider from your preferred editor:

    !!! note "Recommendations"
        {{ product_name }} recommends adding your social and enterprise connections to the first authentication step, as they are used for identifying the user.

    ---
    === "Classic Editor"
        To add OIDC identity provider login using the Classic Editor:

        1. If you haven't already defined a sign-in flow, click **Start with Default configuration** to get started.

        2. Click **Add Authentication** on the step, select your OIDC identity provider, and click **Add**.

            ![Add OIDC identity provider login in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/oidc-enterprise-idp/enable-oidc-enterprise-login-with-basic.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    === "Visual Editor"
        To add OIDC identity provider login using the Visual Editor:

        1. Switch to the **Visual Editor** tab, by default the `Username & Password` login flow will be added onto the Visual Editor's workspace.

        2. Click on `+ Add Sign In Option` to add a new authenticator to the same step and select your OIDC identity provider connection.

3. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## How it works

To provide this login capability, {{ product_name }} uses the standard OpenID Connect with authorization code flow <!-- [OpenID Connect with authorization code flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowSteps)--> underneath. For an application, this flow works as follows:

![Add OIDC enterprise login in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/oidc-enterprise-idp/oidc-enterprise-login-flow.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}
