# Sign-In With Ethereum

**Sign-In With Ethereum** is an open standard for authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/){:target="_blank"} account. The integration uses the open-source OIDC Provider built by [Login.xyz](https://login.xyz){:target="_blank"}, which is hosted under [oidc.signinwithethereum.org](https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org){:target="_blank"}.

Follow this guide for instructions on how to set up Sign-In With Ethereum in {{ product_name }}.

## Register {{ product_name }} in Sign-In With Ethereum

You need to register {{ product_name }} as an OIDC client application in `oidc.signinwithethereum.org`.

!!! note
    Follow the [Sign-In With Ethereum documentation](https://docs.login.xyz/servers/oidc-provider/hosted-oidc-provider){:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.

1. To register a new OIDC client, use the following `curl` command.

    !!! note
        Replace **{organization_name}** with the name of your organization.


    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/register
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d  '{"redirect_uris": ["{{ product_url_format }}/commonauth"]}'
    ```

2. Take note of the `client_id` and `client_secret` returned from the response.

    The following is an example response:

    ```json 
    {
        "client_id": "9b49de48-d198-47e7-afff-7ee26cbcbc95",
        "client_secret": "{secret}",
        "registration_access_token": "{access_token}",
        "registration_client_uri": "https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/client/9b49de48-d198-47e7-afff-7ee26cbcbc95",
        "redirect_uris": ["{{ product_url_format }}/commonauth"]
    }
    ```

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A unique name for this Sign-In With Ethereum identity provider.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client ID</td>
          <td>The client ID obtained from oidc.signinwithethereum.org.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client secret</td>
          <td>The client secret obtained from oidc.signinwithethereum.org.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>  

4. If required, [enable JIT provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/jit-user-provisioning/#enable-jit-user-provisioning).

    !!! note
        If JIT provisioning is enabled, when a user successfully logs in with Sign-In With Ethereum for the first time, a user account is created in the {{ product_name }} Console with the wallet ID. This new user account will be managed by Ethereum. Note that JIT provisioning is disabled by default.

5. In the created connection, go to the **Settings** tab and see the list of scopes to which Sign-In With Ethereum has granted permissions.

    - **openid**: Engages the OpenID flow.
    - **profile**: Allows to view the user's basic profile data.

    !!! note
        {{ product_name }} needs these scopes to get user information. {{ product_name }} checks the attribute configurations of the application and sends the relevant attributes received from Sign-In With Ethereum to the app.
