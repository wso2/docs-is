# Add Google login

You can add Google login to your applications using {{ product_name }} and enable users to log in with their Google accounts.  

Follow this guide for instructions.

## Register {{ product_name }} on Google
You need to register {{ product_name }} as an OAuth2.0 application on Google.

!!! note
    For detailed instructions, you can follow the [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849){:target="_blank"}.

1. Go to the [Google Developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials){:target="_blank"}, create a new project, or select an existing project.

2. If the **APIs & services** page isn't already open, do the following:

    1. Open the navigation menu and click **View all products**.

       ![View all products on the Google console]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/google-idp/view-all-products.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    2. Under **Management**, click **APIs & Services**.

       ![Select APIs & Services]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/google-idp/apis-and-services.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

3. Go to the **Credentials** page, click **Create Credentials**, and select **Oauth client ID**.

4. Configure your consent screen by clicking **Configure Consent Screen** and return to **Create OAuth client ID** screen once you are done.

    !!! note
        For more information, see [User Consent](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849#userconsent&zippy=%2Cuser-consent){:target="_blank"}

5. Select the **Web application** as the application type.
6. Provide a name for your app and the following URL as the **Authorized Redirect URI** of the application:

    ```bash
    {{ product_url_format }}/commonauth
    ```

7. Take note of the client ID and client secret generated for the application.

## Register the Google IdP

Now, let's register the Google IdP in {{ product_name }}.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Connections**.
2. Click **New Connections** and select **Google**.
3. Enter the following details of the Google identity provider and click **Finish**:

    ![Add Google IDP in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/google-idp/add-google-idp.png){: width="600" style="border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A unique name for this Google identity provider.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client ID</td>
          <td>The client ID obtained from Google.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client secret</td>
          <td>The client secret obtained from Google.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

{% include "../../../guides/fragments/manage-connection/jit-provisioning.md" %}

After the Google identity provider is created, go to the **Settings** tab and see the list of **scopes** to which Google has granted permissions.

- **email**: Allows to view the user's email address.
- **openid**: Allows authentication using OpenID Connect and to obtain the ID token.
- **profile**: Allows to view the user's basic profile data.

!!! note
    {{ product_name }} needs these scopes to get user information. {{ product_name }} checks the attribute configurations of the application and sends the relevant attributes received from Google to the app. You can read the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#scope-param){:target="_blank"} to learn more.

## Enable Google login

{% include "../../../guides/fragments/add-login/social-login/add-google-login.md" %}

## Try it out

Follow the steps given below.

1. Access the application URL.
2. Click **Login** to open the {{ product_name }} login page.
3. On the {{ product_name }} login page, **Sign in with Google**.

    ![Login with Google]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/google-idp/sign-in-with-google.png){: width="300" style="border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Log in to Google with an existing user account.

!!! note
    When a user successfully logs in with Google for the first time, a **user** account is created in the {{ product_name }} Console with the Google username. This new user account will be managed by Google.

## Configure connection

To learn more about other configurations available for the connection, refer to the [add federated login]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/federated-login) documentation.
