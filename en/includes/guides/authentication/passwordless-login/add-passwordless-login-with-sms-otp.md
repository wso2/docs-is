# Add SMS OTP Login

SMS OTP (One-Time Password) is a security mechanism where a password, valid for a short duration, is sent to the user's registered mobile number. This password must be entered during the login process.

This method can be used as a form of passwordless authentication, allowing users to log in by providing a one-time passcode received via SMS on their mobile phones, instead of using a traditional password.

To configure SMS OTP as a passwordless authentication mechanism in {{ product_name }}, follow the instructions given below.

## Prerequisites
- To begin, you must [register an application with {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/). You have the option to register your own application or use one of the [sample applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-samples/) available.

- Ensure you have a user account in {{ product_name }}. If not, you can [create a user account]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/#onboard-a-user) within {{ product_name }}.

- [Update the user profile of the users]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/#update-the-profile) with an mobile number to which the user will receive the OTP.

## Set up SMS OTP
{{ product_name }} has some default settings for SMS OTP, which are sufficient for most cases. If required, you can change the default settings, as explained below.

To update the default SMS OTP settings:

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Connections** and select **SMS OTP**.
2. Update the following parameters in the **Settings** tab:

   <table>
         <tr>
           <th style="width: 350px;">Field</th>
           <th>Description</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td><code>SMS OTP expiry time</code></td>
           <td>Specifies the expiry time of the OTP. The generated OTP will not be valid after this expiry time.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td><code>Use only numeric characters for OTP</code></td>
           <td>
               Specifies whether to use only numeric characters in the OTP. If this is selected, the generated OTP contains only digits (0-9).
               If this option is not selected, the OTP will contain alphanumeric characters.
           </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td><code>SMS OTP length</code></td>
           <td>Specifies the number of characters allowed in the OTP.</td>
