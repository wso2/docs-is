# Add MFA based on advanced conditions (using WSO2 Choreo)
You can secure your applications' login flow based on data from an API hosted on [WSO2 Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/){:target="_blank"}. Choreo by WSO2 is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) for innovation, productivity, and simplicityâ€”designed in the cloud for the cloud.

## Scenario
Consider a scenario where the login flow of the application should be stepped up after an API call to a service endpoint hosted on Choreo. The API call should be executed after the first authentication step is successfully completed. The second authentication step should be prompted based on the decision made by the service during the API call.

Let's consider an API hosted on Choreo that reads an IP address from the request body, retrieves geolocation from the IP address, evaluates the risk of the login attempt, and sends back the result in the `hasRisk` parameter in the response. And the second authentication step should be prompted if the `hasRisk` is `true`.

![API calls based adaptive authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/conditional-auth/api-calls-callchoreo.png)

## Prerequisites

- You need to [register an application with {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/). You can register your own application or use one of the [sample applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-samples/) provided.

- Get an API key from [ipgeolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/){:target="_blank"}. For more information, refer to [ipgeolocation documentation](https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Define the MFA conditions

To define the MFA conditions with Choreo, you need to:

1. [Design your MFA condition in a REST API](#desgin-the-rest-api)

2. [Integrate your REST API with Choreo](#integrate-the-rest-api-with-choreo)

### Desgin the REST API
You need to implement your REST API in [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/){:target="_blank"} or any other language and containerize it. You can use the [Ballerina VS code extension](https://ballerina.io/downloads/){:target="_blank"} to develop the REST API in Ballerina. [Learn more](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/){:target="_blank"}.

To implement your REST API to fit the explained scenario:

1. On the VS Code editor, create a `.bal` file and add the following code segment.

     <details>
     <summary>Click to expand code snippet</summary>
     ``` js
     import ballerina/http;

     type RiskResponse record {
     boolean hasRisk;
     };

     type RiskRequest record {
     string ip;
     };

     type ipGeolocationResp record {
     string ip;
     string country_code2;
     };

     final string geoApiKey = "<API key from ipgeolocation.io>";

     service / on new http:Listener(8090) {
     resource function post risk(@http:Payload RiskRequest req) returns RiskResponse|error? {

          string ip = req.ip;
          http:Client ipGeolocation = check new ("https://api.ipgeolocation.io");
          ipGeolocationResp geoResponse = check ipGeolocation->get(string `/ipgeo?apiKey=${geoApiKey}&ip=${ip}&fields=country_code2`);
          
          RiskResponse resp = {
               // hasRisk is true if the country code of the IP address is not the specified country code.
               hasRisk: geoResponse.country_code2 != "<Specify a country code of your choice>"
          };
          return resp;
     }
     }
     ```
     </details>

2. Update the following details:
     <table>
          <tr>
               <th>Parameter</th>
               <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>geoApiKey</code></td>
               <td>The API key obtained from [ipgeolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/){:target="_blank"}.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>geoResponse.country_code2</code></td>
               <td>Country code you would like to allow login attempts.</td>
          </tr>
     </table>

3. Upload the file to your GitHub repository.

### Integrate the REST API with Choreo

To create the REST API component and integrate it with your REST API:

1. [Create an application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/developer-portal/manage-application/#create-an-application){:target="_blank"} on WSO2 Choreo to integrate your REST API with your {{ product_name }} app.

    !!! note
        Note the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.

2. Create a [REST API component on Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/get-started/tutorials/create-your-first-rest-api/#step-1-create){:target="_blank"}.

3. [Deploy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/get-started/quick-start-guide/#step-12-deploy-the-rest-api){:target="_blank"} and [publish](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/get-started/quick-start-guide/#step-14-publish-the-rest-api){:target="_blank"} the REST API.

4. [Subscribe](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/developer-portal/manage-subscription/#subscribe-to-an-api){:target="_blank"} the application you created on Choreo to the REST API.

    !!! note
        The Choreo application exposes the REST API to external clients. Therefore, you can connect to this application from {{ product_name }} and invoke the REST API.

## Configure the login flow

Follow the steps given below.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, click **Applications**.
2. Select the relevant application and go to its **Login Flow** tab.
3. Add MFA based on advanced conditions using your preferred editor:

    ---
    === "Classic Editor"
        To add MFA based on advanced conditions using the classic editor:

        1. Click **Add TOTP as a second factor** to define the login flow, starting with `username and password` and stepping up with `TOTP`.
        2. Turn on **Conditional Authentication** by switching the toggle.

    === "Visual Editor"
        To add MFA based on advanced conditions using the visual editor:

        1. Switch to the **Visual Editor** tab and go to **Predefined Flows** > **Basic Flows** > **Add Multi-factor login**.
        2. Select `Username + Password -> TOTP` and click **Confirm**.
        3. Expand the **Script Editor** to add the script for MFA based on advanced conditions using Choreo.

    ---

    ![Enable conditional auth in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/conditional-auth/enable-conditional-auth.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    You can now define your conditional authentication script.

4. Add the following authentication script.

{{asgardeo_auth_script_warning}}

    ```js
    var connectionMetadata = {
    "url": "<Choreo API URL>",
    "consumerKey": "<Consumer key of the Choreo application>",
    "consumerSecret": "<Consumer secret of the Choreo application>",
    "asgardeoTokenEndpoint": "<Token endpoint of the tenant in Asgardeo>"
    };    
    var onLoginRequest = function(context) {
    executeStep(1, {
         onSuccess: function(context) {
              // Set the IP address of the authentication request as the body of the API call.
              var requestPayload = {
                   "ip": context.request.ip
              };
              Log.info("Calling the API hosted in Choreo!");
              callChoreo(connectionMetadata, requestPayload, {
                   onSuccess: function(context, data) {
                        Log.info('Received risk:' + data.hasRisk);
                        if (data.hasRisk === true) {
                        // Prompt the second authentication factor if the hasRisk is true.
                        executeStep(2);
                        }
                   },
                   onFail: function(context, data) {
                        Log.info('Failed to call Choreo API. Stepping up authentication by    default.');
                        executeStep(2);
                   },
                   onTimeout: function(context, data) {
                        Log.info('Call to Choreo API timed out. Stepping up authentication by default.');
                        executeStep(2);
                   }
              });
         }
    });
    };
    ```

5. Update the following parameters in the script.
     <table>
          <tr>
               <th>Parameter</th>
               <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>url</code></td>
               <td>The URL of the Choreo API.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>consumerKey</code></td>
               <td>The consumer key of the Choreo application.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>consumerSecret</code></td>
               <td>The consumer secret of the Choreo application.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td><code>asgardeoTokenEndpoint</code></td>
               <td>Token endpoint of the organization in Asgardeo. For example: <code>https://api.asgardeo.io/t/{org_name}/oauth2/token</code></td>
          </tr>
     </table>

    ??? note "Use a stored `Secret`"
        If you don't want to enter the `consumerkey` and `consumerSecret` obtained from the Choreo application every time you use the conditional authentication script, you can store them as **Secret**s on Asgardeo.

        - **Using a stored `consumer key` and `consumer secret` in the conditional authentication script.**

             If you are using a stored `consumerSecret`, replace the `connectionMetadata` object of the conditional authentication script as follows:
             ```js
             var connectionMetadata = {
                  "url": "<Choreo API URL>",
                  "consumerKeyAlias": "<The name of the secret that stores the consumer key of Choreo application>",
                  "consumerSecretAlias": "<The name of the secret that stores the consumer secret of Choreo application>"
             };
             ```

        - **Add a stored `consumer key` and `consumer secret` to the script.**

             Select the location in the script where the secret should be inserted, click the key icon above the script, and use one of the following options:
             
             ![Add secret to script]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/secret/add-secret-to-script.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

             - If you are adding an existing secret, click "+" next to the secret in the drop-down menu.
             - If you need a new secret, you can first [create a new secret]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/conditional-auth/configure-conditional-auth/#create-a-new-secret-on-the-console).
                  Now the new secret will be listed when you click the key icon. You can click "+" to add it to the script.

6. Click **Update** to save the configurations.

## How it works
Let's look at how this script works.

1. The `connectionMetadata` object specifies the required values obtained from the WSO2 Choreo application.

2. On successful completion of the authentication step one, `onSuccess()` callback function is called.

3. `onSuccess` callback function calls the `callChoreo()` function, which sends an API call to the API hosted on Choreo.

4. If the API call is successful, the `onSuccess` callback function passed as an argument to the `callChoreo( )` function is called.

     1. If the `hasRisk` value in the response is `true`, step two of the authentication flow is executed.
     2. If the API call fails or times out, step 2 of the authentication flow will be executed by default.


## Try it out

Follow the steps given below.

1. Access the application URL.

2. Try to log in from an IP address within the allowed geolocation. You will successfully log in to the application.

3. Log out of the application.

4. Login from an IP address outside the allowed geolocation. TOTP authentication is prompted.
