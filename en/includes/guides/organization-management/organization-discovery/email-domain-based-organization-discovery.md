# Email domain based organization discovery

In Business-to-Business (B2B) applications, seamlessly authenticating users from external organizations remains essential. This ensures a smooth user experience.

One way to achieve this involves **email domain-based organization discovery**. With this feature, your application can provide a customized login experience. The experience depends on the domain of the user's email address.

For example, when users log in with an `@xyz.com` email address, the system automatically redirects them to the login screen customized for the `XYZ` organization. This provides a familiar and consistent experience.

This guide explains how you may use {{product_name}} to configure email domain-based organization discovery for your B2B applications.

## Scenario

**Guardio Insurance** serves as an insurance provider. *Best Car Mart* and *Glory Car Mart* represent two of its customer organizations.

When a user enters an email address to log into the Guardio Insurance platform, the system needs to resolve the user's organization. It does this based on the email domain. Then it redirects them to the respective organization's login screen.

![Email domain based organization discovery scenario]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/manage-organizations/email-domain-based-organization-discovery.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

In this example scenario:

- User Alice with email `alice@bcmart.com` should go to the login screen of `Best Car Mart` organization.
- User Bob and Ben, with emails `bob@gcmart.com` and `ben@glory.com` should go to the login screen of `Glory Car Mart` organization.

## Prerequisites

Before you configure email domain-based organization discovery, understand the following requirements:

### Username requirements during user creation

For any user to be discoverable by their email domain, the following requirements must be met during user creation:

- The user's **username** must be in a valid email format (for example, `user@company-domain.com`).
- The domain portion of this username (for example, `company-domain.com`) must match one of the domains configured for organization discovery.
- This is a strict requirement during user creation. Attempting to create a user with a non-email username or a username with a non-matching domain for an organization with this feature enabled will fail.

## Enable email domain based organization discovery

!!! note "Important"
    - The root organization only permits enabling this feature and mapping email domains to organizations.
    - **For Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning**: Set the Subject Attribute to `http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress` in your external identity provider. See [Map email domains to organizations](#map-email-domains-to-organizations) below.

=== "Using the Console"

    To do so,

    1. Login to the root organization Console.
    2. Navigate to **Login & Registration**, and under **Organization Settings**, click **Organization Discovery**.
    3. Turn the toggle on to enable email domain based organization discovery.

        ![Enable email domain based organization discovery]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/manage-organizations/enable-email-domain-based-organization-discovery.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    {% if (product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server") %}

    4. Select the **Email domain discovery for self-registration** checkbox if you want to allow users to discover organizations based on their email domain and self-register in them.

        !!! note
            For this to work, child organizations should have self-registration enabled. Currently, you can enable self-registration for all child organizations by adding the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

            ```
            [identity_mgt.user_self_registration]
            allow_self_registration = true
            ```

    {% endif %}

    5. [Map email domains to organizations](#map-email-domains-to-organizations).

=== "Using the API"

    To do so,

    1. [Get an access token]({{base_path}}/apis/#oauth-based-authentication) with the `internal_organization_config_add` scope.

    2. Use the obtained access token to execute the following command.

        ``` curl
        curl --location --request POST 'https://{{ host_name }}{{ organization_path_param }}/api/server/v1/organization-configs/discovery' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
        --data '{
            "properties": [
                {
                    "key": "emailDomain.enable",
                    "value": true
                }
            ]
        }'
        ```

    5. [Map email domains to organizations](#map-email-domains-to-organizations).

## Map email domains to organizations

When you map an email domain to an organization, the organization's behavior changes as follows:

- A user can only onboard to the organization if the user's email domain matches one of the domains claimed by the organization.

{% if product_name == "Asgardeo" or (product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" and is_version == "7.0.0") %}

- Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning during federated authentication only occurs if the user's email domain matches one of the domains claimed by the organization.

    !!! warning "Map subject attribute for JIT provisioning"
        In **OIDC** and **SAML** applications, the subject uniquely identifies the user.

        If your organization uses email domain-based organization discovery, make sure to map the subject attribute correctly as explained below:

        - Set the email attribute as the subject attribute i.e. `http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress`.
        - Map the email attribute from the external identity provider to the same WSO2 claim: `http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress`.

        **Why this matters**: Domain-based organization discovery relies on email addresses to identify organizations. Mapping the subject attribute to the email claim ensures that Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning creates and updates users correctly.

        Learn more about selecting [selecting the subject attribute]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/user-attributes/enable-attributes-for-oidc-app/#select-an-alternate-subject-attribute) for OIDC applications and [selecting the subject attribute]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/user-attributes/enable-attributes-for-saml-app/#select-the-subject-attribute) for SAML applications.

{% else %}

- The system restricts federated authentication and Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning for users logging in with email domains not claimed by the organization.

    !!! warning "Map subject attribute for JIT provisioning and federated authentication"
        In **OIDC** and **SAML** applications, the subject uniquely identifies the user.

        - Map the email attribute from the external identity provider to the same WSO2 claim: `http://wso2.org/claims/emailaddress`.

        **Why this matters**: Domain-based organization discovery relies on email addresses to identify organizations. Mapping the subject attribute to the email claim ensures smooth federated authentication and Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning creates and updates users correctly.

{% endif %}

- If not, a user can register to the organization with an email address of any domain (other than the domains claimed by other organizations).
