# Try a B2B use case (with organization)

The following guide is a complete end-to-end use case on how to manage B2B (Business-to-Business) applications in {{ product_name }}.

## Scenario

You are an administrator of **Guardio Insurance**, which is a company that provides its services to other business organizations.

**Best Car Mart** has a partnership with Guardio Insurance to provide life insurance policies to its employees. Guardio Insurance exposes its services to Best Car Mart's employees through 
its **Guardio Insurance Business App** and **Guardio Insurance Administrative App**.

   - **Guardio Insurance Administrative App** - Application that provides administrative capabilities to administrators of **Guardio** customer/partner organizations.
   The provided administrative capabilities are managing users, assigning roles, configuring an identity provider for the organization, and customize the login flow of **Guardio Insurance Business App** business application for their organizations.

   - **Guardio Insurance Business App** -  Application that provides insurance and claims settlement capabilities for other
     businesses, so that those businesses can use the software for internal requirements.

The employees of Best Car Mart should be able to log in to the Guardio Insurance applications to consume its services. The administrators of Best Car Mart will manage the users of its organization and also determine the login experience that their users should have.

{% if product_name == "Asgardeo" %}
## Prerequisites

You should [create a root organization]({{base_path}}/guides/{{root_org_description_path}}). For this example we have created a root organization named `Guardio Insurance`.
{% endif %}

## Set up the applications
The following guides explain how you can share an application with organizations and allow organization users to log in to it using **SSO**.

Let's use the sample applications, [Guardio Insurance Business application and Guardio Insurance Administrative application](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/tree/master/b2b-sample){:target="_blank"}, to explore this use case.

### Step 1: Register the applications on {{ product_name }}

Follow the steps given below to register the Guardio Insurance applications with {{ product_name }}.

1. Login into the organization(root).
2. [Register Traditional Web Applications]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/register-oidc-web-app/) in your organization (root) with the following settings:

   - Register **Guardio Insurance Business App**
    
     <table>
          <tr>
              <th>Application Name</th>
              <td>Add a name for the application.</br>
                  <code>Guardio-Business-App</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <th>Protocol</th>
              <td>The authentication protocol to use.</br>
                  <code>OpenID Connect</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <th>Authorized redirect URLs</th>
              <td>The URLs to which the authorization code is sent to upon authentication and where the user is redirected to upon logout.</br>
                  <code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/wso2is</code>
                  <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
      </table>

   - Register **Guardio Insurance Administrative App**
    
     <table>
          <tr>
              <th>Application Name</th>
              <td>Add a name for the application.</br>
                  <code>Guardio-Admin-App</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <th>Protocol</th>
              <td>The authentication protocol to use.</br>
                  <code>OpenID Connect</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <th>Authorized redirect URLs</th>
              <td>The URLs to which the authorization code is sent to upon authentication and where the user is redirected to upon logout.</br>
                  <code>http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/wso2isAdmin</code>
                  <code>http://localhost:3001</code>
              </td>
          </tr>
      </table>

### Step 2: Share the applications with organizations

Share the <b>Guardio-Business-App</b> and <b>Guardio-Admin-App</b> with your organizations. See instructions on how to [share applications with organizations]({{base_path}}/guides/organization-management/share-applications/).

When the application is shared to at least one organization, **Sign In with SSO** will be added as a login option in the application login screen, which organization users can use to log in.

### Step 3: Configure the applications on {{ product_name }}
To configure the registered application on {{ product_name }}:

On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Applications** and select the application you registered.

**Protocol Configurations**

1. Go to the **Protocol** tab of the application, configure the following values.

    !!!note 
        If you have selected `Traditional Web Application` template for application creation, the following values should have already set properly.
