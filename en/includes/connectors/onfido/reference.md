# Reference

This reference provides a complete, end-to-end overview of how to integrate Onfido for identity verification with {{product_name}} and use it within your applications.

The process involves the following general steps:

## Administrator sets up Onfido and {{product_name}}

The administrator performs the initial setup required to integrate Onfido with {{product_name}}. This includes configuring both the Onfido platform and the {{product_name}} Console. The steps are as follows:

- The administrator logs into the Onfido dashboard and,

    - Creates an Onfido workflow that defines the verification steps and requirements.

    - Generates credentials such as the API token and the workflow ID.

- The administrator logs into the {{product_name}} Console and,

    - Creates an identity verification provider (IdVP) for Onfido using the API credentials obtained from Onfido.

    - Obtains the URL generated by {{product_name}} to receive verification status updates from Onfido.

- The administrator returns to the Onfido dashboard and creates a webhook using the URL obtained from {{product_name}}. {{product_name}} receives verification status updates from Onfido through this webhook.

- The administrator returns to the {{product_name}} Console and registers the webhook token in the Onfido connector configuration.

## Developer integrates identity verification into the application

The developer uses the Onfido SDK to integrate identity verification into the application. The Onfido SDK provides the necessary tools and components to capture user information and documents for verification.

## User undergoes identity verification

When a user attempts to access the application, the following steps occur:

- The user logs into the application.

- If the user's attributes need verification, the application sends a request to {{product_name}} to initiate the identity verification process.

- {{product_name}} interacts with Onfido to start the verification process. During this process,
  
    - {{product_name}} creates an applicant in Onfido.

    - Runs an instance of the workflow for the applicant and generates a workflow run ID.

    - Generates an SDK token that allows the application to use the Onfido SDK for capturing user information.

- {{product_name}} returns the workflow run ID and the SDK token to the application.

- The application uses the Onfido SDK along with the SDK token to capture the user's information and documents required for verification.

- The application sends a request to {{product_name}} to finalize the verification process.

## {{product_name}} completes the verification

{{product_name}} does the following to complete the verification process:

- Onfido notifies {{product_name}} of the verification results through the configured webhook.

- {{product_name}} updates the verification status of the user attributes based on the results received from Onfido.

- {{product_name}} responds to the application's request with the verification results.
