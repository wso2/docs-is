# Configure custom domains
<Badge text="Paid subscription required" type="warn" />

!!! warning
    You need a paid Asgardeo subscription to use this feature. If you donâ€™t already have one, view the available [subscription plans](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/pricing/) and contact the Asgardeo sales team.

By default, the Asgardeo interfaces presented to your users (during the login, sign-up, and account recovery flows), as well as the back-end services (such as APIs), are served by Asgardeo on the following domains:

- **User interfaces**: `https://accounts.asgardeo.io/t/{org_name}`
- **Services**: `https://api.asgardeo.io/t/{org_name}`

With domain branding, you can customize the above endpoints to have hostnames specific to your organization. For example, if your organization is **Foo**, you can have the following custom domains:

- **User interfaces**: `https://accounts.foo.com`
- **Services**: `https://api.foo.com`

!!! note Custom domain branding for B2B applications
    If you have configured [suborganizations]({{base_path}}/guides/organization-management/manage-b2b-organizations/manage-suborganizations/), note that the custom domain you configure for your root organization also applies to your suborganizations.

If you have a paid Asgardeo subscription and wish to implement a custom domain for your organization, contact Asgardeo support through the [WSO2 cloud support portal](https://cloud-support.wso2.com/) or send a request email to `asgardeo-help@wso2.com` and the team will get back to you with instructions.
Note that email and support portal requests should be sent from the respective account of an administrator.
