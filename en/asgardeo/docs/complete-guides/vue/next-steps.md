!!! tip "Tip"

    As you are now familiar with the concepts discussed in the guide, you can use the Asgardeo Vue template to bootstrap your application by running the following command.

    ```bash
    npx tmplr --dir my-vite-vue-app asgardeo/asgardeo-vite-vue-template
    ```
    The Asgardeo Vue template generates a ready-made Vue sample app with pre-configured login and logout capabilities, helping you kick-start your project in just 2 minutes.

    All you need is a `client_id`, which you can obtain by registering a **Single Page Application** in {{product_name}}.

Now that your Vue application is secured with authentication features integrated, It is time to explore the additional features {{product_name}} offers to make the login flow more diverse and secure.
