# Managing the Version of a XACML Policy

You can manage the version of a XACML policy using the instructions in
this topic.

1.  Sign in. Enter your user name and password to log on to the
    [Management Console]({{base_path}}/deploy/get-started/get-started-with-the-management-console/)
    .
2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Entitlement** menu.
    Click **Policy Administration** under **PAP**.
3.  Click **Versions** next to the policy you require.  

    The following information is provided in the resulting screen.
    -   **Entitlement Policy Id** - This is the name of the policy you
        created.

    -   **Entitlement Policy Version** - This is the version of the
        policy. Basically a new version is created for every change made
        to the policy so you can view and select the relevant version of
        the policy using the dropdown available.

    -   **Entitlement Policy Version Created Time** - This is a
        timestamp of when exactly the version of the policy you are
        viewing was created.

    -   **Entitlement Policy Version Created User** - This indicated
        which user or tenant created the version of the policy you are
        viewing.
