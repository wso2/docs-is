# Connect {{ product_name }} as an OIDC attribute provider for verifiable credentials (VC) with Microsoft Entra Verified ID

[Microsoft Entra Verified ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id) is a verifiable credential issuance and verification service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to generate, present, and verify their digital identities.

Microsoft allows configuring an IDP (such as {{ product_name }}) as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) attribute provider for verifiable credentials using their `idTokens` attestation in which the claims provided through the OIDC id token is used to generate the verifiable credential.

#### Verifying credentials
![verify credentials]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/entra-verify-credentials-diagram.png){: width="880" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

This tutorial explains how this is done using {{ product_name }} and Microsoft Entra. Given below are the high-level steps you will follow:

1. Configure Microsoft Entra Verified ID to issue verifiable credentials.
2. Configure {{ product_name }} as an OIDC attribute provider.
3. Try out the Microsoft Verified ID Node JS sample.

## Sample scenario

Consider the sample use case given below.

Krusty Krab is a fast-food restaurant owned and operated by Mr. Krabs. Krusty Krab has an employee management system where employees can log in and perform their employee-related operations, such as payroll handling, expense reimbursement, etc.

Krusty Krab utilizes {{ product_name }} as their identity provider. Every Krusty Krab employee has an account in the {{ product_name }}.

Recently Mr. Krabs decided to issue employee credentials to their employees using Verifiable Credentials, which the employees can then use to prove their employment at Krusty Krab.

## Step 1: Configure Microsoft Azure for verifiable credentials

!!! note "Before you begin"
    To proceed with this tutorial, you need to have a tenant with an active Azure subscription. If you haven't claimed an Azure subscription before, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) for free and claim $200 credits.

    Before proceeding with this tutorial, check all the prerequisites mentioned in the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant#prerequisites).

### Step 1.1: Create a key vault

First, we need to create an Azure key vault instance to store the public and private keys generated by the Verified ID service.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and from the home page select **Create a resource**.
2. Select **Key Vault** and click **Create**.
3. Provide the following information and click **Review + Create**.

    !!! tip
            Leave the rest of the values to their defaults.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Configuration
            </th>
            <th>
                Description
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Subscription
            </td>
            <td>
                Select your subscription if not already selected.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Resource group
            </td>
            <td>
                Select the resource group. You can create a new resource group if you don't already have one.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Key vault name
            </td>
            <td>
                Enter a unique name for the key vault.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Region
            </td>
            <td>
                Select the region.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    ![create vault key]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-1.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Review the details and click **Create**.

### Step 1.2: Set access policies for the key vault

A key vault access policy defines the security principles that can perform operations on the secrets and keys stored in the key vault. You need to define access policies for both the Verified ID Service Administrator account and the Request Service API Principal.

1. On the Azure portal, go to the previously created Key Vault instance, and from the left menu, select **Access policies**.
2. Select the user account that you need to configure access policies for and click **Edit** from the upper menu.

3. Verify that the following key permissions are enabled.

    !!! tip
            `Sign` should be the only key permission you need to update.

    - **Key Management Operations**: Create, Delete
    - **Cryptographic Operations**: Sign

    ![access policies for key vault]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-2.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Click **Next** and then save the changes.

### Step 1.3: Set up Verified ID

The next step is to create and set up a Verified ID service instance.

1. On the Azure portal, search for “verified ID”, select the listed Verified ID tile, and select **Setup** from the left menu.

    ![set up verified ID]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-3.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    Now, you will see three tiles, as shown in the above image.

2. Click **Update** under **Define organization settings**.

    !!! note
        In this step, you're required to provide a domain for your organization. This domain binds your decentralized ID (DID) to something tangible that the users might know about your business. It'll be used for all of your credentials. Digital wallets use this information to validate that your DID is linked to your domain.

        For this tutorial, let's deploy a simple web application in vercel. Later, you're required to host some DID well-known files on this site.

3. Enter an organization name and a trusted domain, and then select the key vault you created previously for the key vault.

4. Under **Advanced settings**, you can select the trust system.

    !!! note
        By default, this is selected as **Web**. As per your preference, you can change this to **ION**.

    ![define organization setting]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-4.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

5. Save the updates.

!!! note
    When you set up the verified ID, the access policies in the Azure key vault are automatically updated to give the required permissions for service principles of the verified ID.

### Step 1.4: Register an application in Azure AD

In this tutorial, let's use a Microsoft verifiable credentials sample web application to configure credential issuance and verification. For the sample application to invoke the Microsoft Entra Verified ID, you need to register an application on the Azure portal and grant API permissions.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and search for “Azure active directory”.

2. Select **App registrations** from the left menu and click **New registration**.

3. Provide a display name for your application and select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)** for the supported account types.

4. Click **Register** to complete the registration.

    ![register app in Azure]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-5.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

Now, we need to grant permissions to the application to access the “Verifiable Credentials Service Request” service principal.

1. Go to the created application on the Azure portal and select API permissions from the left menu.
2. Click **Add a permission** and select **APIs my organization uses**.
3. Search for “Verifiable Credentials Service Request” and click the listed tile.

    ![verifiable credentials service request]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-6.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Choose **Application Permission** and check **VerifiableCredential.Create.All**.
5. Click **Add permission** and then select **Grant admin consent** for your tenant name.

    ![request API permissions]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-7.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    !!! note
            You can choose to grant issuance and presentation permissions separately if you prefer to segregate the scopes into different applications.

Next, we need to create a client secret for the registered application.

1. From the left menu, select **Certificates & secrets** and click **New client secret**.
2. Give a description and an expiry time for the secret.

    ![VC app certificates and secrets]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-8.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

Be sure to keep a record of the secret's value. You'll use this value for a configuration in a later step. The secret value won't be displayed again and isn't retrievable by any other means.

### Step 1.5: Register your decentralized ID

Now, you need to complete setting up the Azure Verified ID service. You can skip this step if you have selected `did:ion` as your trust system.

1. Go back to the Verified ID service and select **Setup** from the left menu.
2. Click **Register** under **Register decentralized ID** to register your DID document.
3. Copy or download the DID document and host the JSON file in the **/.well-known** directory on your web server.

    ![decentralized ID]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-9.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. After hosting the file, click **Refresh registration status**.

    !!! tip
            If the system can access the hosted file, it is indicated by a green tick on the status.

### Step 1.6: Verify domain ownership

Now, you need to verify domain ownership to establish trust between the DID and the domain.

1. Click **Verify** under **Verify domain ownership**.
2. Copy or download the manifest file and host it under the `/.well-known` directory of your web server.

    ![verify domain ownership]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-10.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

3. After hosting the file, click **Refresh verification status**.

    !!! tip
            If the system can access the hosted file, it is indicated by a green tick on the status.

With that, you have completed setting up the Entra Verified ID instance. Now you should be seeing all the tiles with a green tick, as shown below.

![welcome to Entra verified ID]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-11.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

## Step 2: Configure {{ product_name }} as the OIDC attribute provider

In this step, you will configure the connection between {{ product_name }} and the Microsoft Verified ID service. Here, we need to create an application in {{ product_name }} with the Mobile template.

1. On the [{{ product_name }} Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/), go to **Applications**.

2. Click **New Application** and select **Mobile Application**:

    ![register new app in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-12.png){: width="800" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

3. Enter the following details:

    ![add mobile app configurations]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-13.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>A unique name to identify your application.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Authorized redirect URLs</td>
            <td>Enter <code>vcclient://openid/</code> as the authorized redirect URI. Be sure to click the plus sign in front of the redirect uri input field.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

4. Click **Register** to complete the registration.

5. Go to the **User Attributes** tab, mark the required attributes as **Mandatory**, and click **Update** to save the changes.

    ![add user attributes to mobile app]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-14.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    !!! tip
            Be sure to copy the scopes displayed on the page.

6. Go to the **Protocol** tab, clear the **PKCE** checkbox, and click **Update** to save the changes.

    !!! note
        - PKCE is disabled as it is not required for the tutorial.
        - The listed configurations in the **Guide** tab are needed for the next step of the tutorial.

7. Go to **User Management** > **Users** on the {{ product_name }} Console and add a new user from there.

    !!! note
        This step is required to ensure you can log in to the application. You need a business user registered in the {{ product_name }} to be able to perform user login.

    ![add new user]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-15.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

## Step 3: Create a verifiable credential for the ID token

Now, let's create a credential for the Verified ID service with the id token attestation type.

1. On the Azure portal, go to the previously configured Verified ID service, and select **Credentials** from the left menu.
2. Click **Add a credential**, select **Custom credential** as the credential type, and click **Next**.
3. On the credential creation page, provide a unique credential name.
4. Adjust the JSON content under the **Display** definition as per your requirement.

    !!! note
        This defines the style of the verifiable credential card stored in the wallet. By default, this only contains texts for the English language. If you want to support multiple locales, add multiple entries as a comma-separated list.

    ```js
    // The sample display definition used for the tutorial.
    {
    "locale": "en-US",
    "card": {
        "backgroundColor": "#FB8114",
        "description": "Use your verified credential to prove to anyone that you are an employee of Krusty Krab.",
        "issuedBy": "Krusty Krab",
        "textColor": "#000000",
        "title": "Employee Credential",
        "logo": {
        "description": "Krusty Krab Logo",
        "uri": "https://krusty-krab-vc-issuer.vercel.app/resources/logo-wobg.png"
        }
    },
    "consent": {
        "instructions": "Sign in with your {{ product_name }} account to get your card.",
        "title": "Do you want to get your Krusty Krab Verified Credential?"
    },
    "claims": [
        {
        "claim": "vc.credentialSubject.userName",
        "label": "User name",
        "type": "String"
        },
        {
        "claim": "vc.credentialSubject.displayName",
        "label": "Display name",
        "type": "String"
        },
        {
        "claim": "vc.credentialSubject.firstName",
        "label": "First name",
        "type": "String"
        },
        {
        "claim": "vc.credentialSubject.lastName",
        "label": "Last name",
        "type": "String"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```

5. Configure the **Rules definition**.

    !!! note
        This is the most important part, where we add configurations for the connection with {{ product_name }}. The rules definition determines what the user should do to get the credential.

        Here, the attestation should be an `idTokens` attestation, and the rules definition should contain the {{ product_name }} application's client ID, openid configuration url, scopes, and claim mappings. See the below table to learn how to retrieve these values on {{ product_name }}.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Key
            </th>
            <th>
                Description
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                clientId
            </td>
            <td>
                The OAuth 2.0 Client ID received from the created {{ product_name }} application.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                configuration
            </td>
            <td>
                The OpenID Connect identity provider metadata discovery endpoint of the {{ product_name }}.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                redirectUri
            </td>
            <td>
                The URL to which the authorization code is sent upon user authentication.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                scope
            </td>
            <td>
                The scopes requested from the {{ product_name }} application.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                mapping
            </td>
            <td>
                The output and input claim mappings for VC and {{ product_name }}. You'll be able to find the identifier for the <code>inputClaim</code> from the <b>User Attributes</b> tab of the created {{ product_name }} application.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    ```json
    // The sample rules definition used for the tutorial.
        {
        "attestations": {

            "KrustyKrabCredential"
            ]
        }
        }
    ```

6. Click **Create** to save the changes.

7. Go to the created verifiable credential, click **Issue credential**, and take note of the following information.

    !!! tip
            This information is required when configuring the sample application.

    - **Authority**: The decentralized identifier.
    - **Manifest**: URL that the authenticator evaluates before displaying the verifiable credential issuance requirements.

## Step 4: Configure the application

You have now completed all the configurations for trying out the verifiable credential flow. In this tutorial, you will be using the Azure verifiable credential Node JS sample application.

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the sample code by visiting the following URL:

    ```bash 
    https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials-node
    ```

2. Open the `config.json` file inside the **1-node-api-idtokenhint** folder and provide values for the required configurations as explained below.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Configuration
            </th>
            <th>
                Description
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                azTenantId
            </td>
            <td>
                The ID of your tenant. You can get this from the <b>Overview</b> section of Azure Active Directory component.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                azClientId
            </td>
            <td>
                The client ID of the Azure application. You can get this from the created application in the Azure Active Directory component.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                azClientSecret
            </td>
            <td>
                The client secret you created for the Azure application.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
            CredentialManifest
            </td>
            <td>
                The manifest URL received from the Verified ID credential.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                IssuerAuthority
            </td>
            <td>
                The issuer authority of the Verified ID credential.
            </td>
        </tr>

3. Leave the rest of the configurations empty and save the file.

4. Open the `presentation_request_config.json` file and modify the following values under the `requestedCredentials` object as per your VC configurations:

    - `acceptedIssuers`: Your VC issuer authorities.
    - `type`: Your VC type.

## Step 5: Try it out

Now, let's run the application and try out the verifiable credential issuance and verification flows.

### Step 5.1: Start the application

Follow the step below to start the application.

1. Open a terminal, navigate to the `1-node-api-idtokenhint` folder, and run the following command:

    ```bash 
    npm install && npm start
    ```

2. Set up **Ngrok**:

    !!! note
            The sample application runs on port 8080. You can visit the sample application by opening the `http://localhost:8080` URL. However, to try out the VC flow, the website must be available via a public URL. Let's use **Ngrok** for this tutorial.

    1. Download and install Ngork on your computer.
    2. Go to the Ngrok directory and open a new terminal.
    3. Run the below command to host the sample application with Ngrok.

        ```bash 
        ./ngrok http 8080
        ```

3. Open the displayed public URL, and you'll see the MS verifiable credential sample application.

    !!! note
        Microsoft Verifiable Credentials use the Microsoft Authenticator app as the digital wallet. Hence, prior to trying out the sample, you need to download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.

### Step 5.2: Get the verifiable credential

To get the KrustyKrab verifiable credential:

1. Click **Get Credential** on the above sample website.

    !!! note
        If everything is configured correctly, the website shows you a QR code.

    ![issuance of employee credential]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-17.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

2. Open your Microsoft Authenticator app and go to the **Verified IDs** tab.

    You'll be able to scan the QR code there.

    ![scan QR code]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-18.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

3. Scan the QR and you'll see an option to sign in with {{ product_name }}.

4. Click **Sign In with {{ product_name }}**, and you are redirected to the login page provided by {{ product_name }}.

5. Sign in with the user account you added previously.

    ![sign in]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-19.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    After successful authentication, you are redirected to the Microsoft Authenticator app.

6. Click **Add** to add the KrustyKrab credential to your wallet.

    ![add to wallet]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-20.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

You can view the user details you received from {{ product_name }} by clicking the verifiable credential card inside the wallet.

### Step 5.3: Verify the credential

Now that you have added the KrustyKrab credential to the wallet, you can use it to verify the Krusty Krab employment.

1. Go back to the home page of the sample website and click **Verify Credential**.

    ![presentation of credential type - 1]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-21.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    If everything is configured correctly, the website shows you a QR code.

2. Scan the available QR code using the Microsoft Authenticator app, and it will prompt you to share the KrustyKrab credential.

    ![presentation of credential type -2]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-22.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

3. Click **Share**.

The sample website now receives the user details from the KrustyKrab credential.

![credentials received]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/oidc-attribute-provider-ms/img-23.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

Now that you have successfully configured {{ product_name }} as an OIDC attribute provider for Microsoft Entra verifiable credentials, you can continue to harness the full capabilities that {{ product_name }} provides by customizing the sign-in flow, enhancing application security, etc.
