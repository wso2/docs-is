# Branding

By default, the business applications of your organization in WSO2 Identity Server are presented to your users with WSO2 Identity Server branding. You have the option of using your own branding as follows:

- [Customize the user interfaces (UIs)]({{base_path}}/guides/branding/configure-ui-branding/) of the user login, sign-up, and account recovery flows.

- [Customize email notifications]({{base_path}}/guides/branding/customize-email-templates/)

- [Configure email provider]({{base_path}}/guides/branding/configure-email-providers/)
