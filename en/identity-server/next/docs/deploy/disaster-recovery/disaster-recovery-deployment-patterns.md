# Disaster Recovery Deployment Patterns for WSO2 Identity Server

The following disaster recovery mechanism describes an implementation of the generic 
deployment architecture along with a few suggested modifications that can be done to 
suit further requirements. The strategy falls in between [Cold and Warm deployments]({{base_path}}/deploy/disaster-recovery/additional-reading-on-disaster-recovery/#spectrum-of-disaster-recovery-architectures) in 
the spectrum, and is **based on services provided by Microsoft Azure**. 

!!! note
    This document **only** describes how to apply disaster recovery strategies to a WSO2 Identity
    Server deployment, and does not provide information on how to set up the deployment.
    For information on how to deploy WSO2 Identity Server, see [here]({{base_path}}/deploy/deployment-guide.md).

The above diagram depicts the normal operation of the deployment where the primary region actively 
receives traffic and the data is replicated to the DR passive region. The DR region is running in 
a relatively cold state, i.e. it is not ready to receive traffic immediately but its data stores 
will be in sync with the primary. When the Primary region becomes unavailable, the failover 
mechanism is triggered. The Storage Account and Database in the DR region will be converted to 
resources with read-write access and the Cluster will be started and scaled up. Finally, the LB 
will be configured to direct network traffic to the new active region, thus completing the DR 
pipeline.

## Replication Configurations
The datastores of WSO2 Identity Server are the databases and file stores, which need to be
replicated to the passive region to maintain data consistency between the two regions. 

### Database Replication
Generally, the Identity Server is set up with the Identity and Shared databases only, with the 
Identity database handling session data as well. Session data gets frequently updated in the 
database as users continue to interact with applications. Conventional replication methods may 
not be able to keep up with the high volume of data and that may lead to an uncertain RPO. If a
better RPO is required in cases where even frequently updated data (tokens, sessions, etc) need
to be replicated immediately with more certainty, other database specific replication services 
such as Oracle GoldenGate, MySQL Replication, etc, could be set up with prioritized table level
replication configured for the more frequently updated tables.

However, **it is recommended to [configure a separate database to store session data]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure/databases/carbon-database/change-datasource-session)** as this provides
flexibility to handle the very frequently updated session data. Having replication enabled for 
such a database will incur very high costs. Therefore, separating out the session database from
the identity database, and disabling geo-replication for the session database will help drive down
costs. In most cases, it is acceptable for the enterprise to lose end-user logins and sessions, as
a downtime involved in switching to a passive data center and providing a user experience without 
re-login may not be practical.

**GRS (RA-GRS) replication** offered by general Azure database services replicate data in near 
real-time, with a lag that depends on the workload and the network latency between the primary 
and secondary regions. Default replication services can be used for this purpose. Hence, the 
impact from DB replication on RPO would be minimal, or uncertain in rare cases if there is a 
high workload or latency. The time taken to convert the secondary region replica to the primary
Database with read-write access would be between 5-10 minutes, thereby increasing the RTO by 10
minutes.

### File Store Replication
File artifacts replication techniques are required to backup the runtime artifacts created when 
tenants and userstores are generated in the Identity Server. File artifacts replication techniques 
tend to have adverse impacts on the RPO and RTO as their failover time is generally high, and using 
custom tools to reduce failover time may increase costs. **If the enterprise application is not going
to make use of tenants and userstores in the Identity Server**, then these replication mechanisms can
be disregarded altogether.

**GRS replication** for File Shares storage accounts can be used to handle the replication of the file
system (tenants and userstores). Although **RA-GRS** is available for the storage account as a whole, 
only GRS is available for File Shares (i.e. secondary region cannot be read while the primary is 
active until a failover occurs). But this is not a requirement in this case as this is a Cold DR 
strategy. File Share replication occurs in near real-time as well, hence the impact on RPO is 
minimal when the default GRS replication is used. The downside of using File Share replication is 
that the failover mechanism which converts the replica to the primary could take an hour to 
complete, which adversely affects the RTO. To address the impact on RTO, a different approach 
could be followed where the entire storage account is cloned at intervals using an Automation 
task. This is also the ideal approach to follow in cases where Premium storage is required as 
it does not offer GRS replication. The Automation task can help to reduce the RTO vastly but it 

## Deployment Pattern Variations
These replication configurations of this deployment can be altered to achieve various combinations
of RPO/RTO at different costs.

### Failover Completion

Once failover is triggered, scaling up the k8s cluster and starting the servers will 
consume about 5-10 mins, i.e. RTO + 10. After the databases, fileshares and clusters 
are ready, updating loadbalancer to direct traffic to the new DR region would take 
another 5 mins (RTO + 5). The diagram below shows the new state of the deployment once
failover is complete.
