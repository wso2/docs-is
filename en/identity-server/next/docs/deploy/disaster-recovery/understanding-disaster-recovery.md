# Understanding Disaster Recovery in WSO2 Identity Server

In todayâ€™s rapidly growing digital landscape, businesses and organizations rely heavily 
on technology to power their operations. High availability and minimal downtime is a 
necessity for business-critical systems to run smoothly. In the event of a natural 
catastrophe like a hurricane, flood, earthquake, or a human-made crisis such as a 
cyberattack, prolonged system failures would most likely happen which could pose 
dire consequences on business operations. Hence, implementing disaster recovery 
mechanisms will be extremely beneficial to mitigate the effects of regional system 
failures. In case of a failure of the main deployment, it should be possible to 
transition a part or all of the traffic to an alternate region so that the applications 
can continue running. To implement Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies in an enterprise 
application system that is using WSO2 Identity Server, the Identity Server deployment 
should be set up in a way that enables synchronization of certain data and runtime
artifacts, which will be explored in this document. 

### Key Terms of Disaster Recovery

In order to determine the type of deployment pattern required as per the business
needs, the following metrics will be taken into consideration.

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** - 
    The RTO refers to the maximum amount of time an application can be statistically expected to be offline.

2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** - 
    The RPO refers to how much data loss can be considered acceptable.

The values of these metrics are usually determined by the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
between the service provider and the consumers. The SLA represents a commitment from 
the service provider to deliver a specified level of availability and outlines the 
consequences of failing to meet this agreement. Evidently, smaller values for RTO and 
RPO indicate a requirement for the application to recover quickly from disruptions. 
The exact specifications of the DR deployment patterns will depend on the RTO and 
RPO selected. 

DR deployment patterns, which are analogous to High Availability (HA) patterns, define
the speed at which a system can recover after a disaster. These patterns describe the
processes and procedures that are in place to ensure that the system can return to 
normal operations in a timely manner. In essence, the RTO and RPO are key metrics in 
defining the expected service level during a disaster event which causes the primary 
system to fail.

## Steps for Defining RTO and RPO Metrics for WSO2 Identity Server

#### 1. Business Impact Analysis (Identify Critical Systems and Data)
Determine the criticality of WSO2 Identity Server to the business application and the 
impact of each data aspect (identity information, tokens, sessions, etc) on business 
operations. Identify the applications or systems integrated with the WSO2 Identity 
Server and critical to the business operations and determine the expected level of 
service for each one. The following questions may help in the analysis.

- Which applications are most critical to the business?
- How much of the critical business application functionality is dependent on the availability of the Identity Server?
- How frequently would Identity Server tenants and userstores be created?
- Should user sessions persist even in the event of a disaster?

#### 2. Assess the Impact of Downtime
Based on the business criticality, determine the maximum downtime the organization can
afford for each application or system. I.e. determine the potential impact of downtime 
on each critical system. This includes financial, operational, and reputational impacts.
Also, determine the impact of the Identity Server being unavailable for running business 
applications. For example, an application may be able to provide some level of 
functionality without the Identity Server. The functionality of the application that 
does require a working Identity Server could also be crucial to the business.

#### 3. Define RTO
Calculate the RTO based on the above information. The RTO is the expected upper bound 
of the time it should take to recover the application or system after a disaster. This 
value should be less than or equal to the maximum downtime defined earlier. Define 
specific RTOs for each critical system. For example, you might determine that your 
email system must be restored within 4 hours, but a less critical system can have an
RTO of 24 hours. The RTO of the Identity Server may need to be aligned with the RTO of 
the most critical system.

#### 4. Define RPO
Calculate the RPO based on the above information. The RPO is the acceptable amount of 
time during which the data might be lost. This value should be less than or equal to 
the maximum data loss the organization can afford. Define specific RPOs for each critical
system. For example, it might be determined that customer identity data must be 
recoverable up to the last 15 minutes before the disruption occurred.

#### 5. Select Appropriate Recovery Strategies
Pick suitable data replication services that can achieve your expected RTO and RPO and
design a manual or automated DR switch process to meet business needs. Choose [recovery 
strategies]({{base_path}}/deploy/disaster-recovery/disaster-recovery-deployment-patterns/#deployment-pattern-variations) and [technologies]({{base_path}}/deploy/disaster-recovery/additional-reading-on-disaster-recovery/#replication-technologies) that align with the RTOs and RPOs. This may involve redundant
systems, data backups, and failover solutions.

## Deployment Architecture Basics of WSO2 Identity Server

The implementation of Disaster Recovery (DR) deployment for the WSO2 Identity Server can 
be achieved by following an Active and Passive region architecture as per the below 
diagram. In this architecture, the passive region deployment can be maintained in a 
cold state and activated in the event of a disaster.

### Usual Regional Operation

**Region A** region is the primary region, which hosts the active site where user traffic
is actively processed. It includes the primary database server, primary filestores of 
IS runtime artifacts, and active Identity Server instances which accept all network 
traffic. Clustering and load balancing are set up for high availability within this region.

**Region B** serves as the disaster recovery site, remaining idle until needed. 
It includes the passive secondary database server and secondary filestores, which are 
read-only replicas of their primary counterparts. Data from the primary database server
and filestores are replicated to the secondary database server and filestore respectively
in the passive region to ensure data consistency. The Identity Server instances remain 
downscaled and idle in this region until a failover occurs.

    - To ensure all necessary runtime file-based artifacts, such as user store configurations
    and tenant configurations, are replicated to the passive region, a file artifacts 
    replication service should be utilized in the deployment process. To learn more about file
    artifacts in a WSO2 Identity Server deployment, see [here]({{base_path}}/deploy/deployment-guide/#enable-artifact-synchronization).
    - Additionally, databases must be replicated using a geo-replication service to the 
    passive region. 
    - It is also important to note that any user stores utilized by the enterprise, such 
    as Active Directory or LDAP, must be replicated accordingly to the passive region.

### Failover and Recovery Operation

When a disaster or failure occurs, causing the primary region to become unavailable, 
the failover mechanism is triggered. Traffic is redirected to Region B, and Identity 
Server instances that were passive become active.

In the event of a disaster, the WSO2 Identity Servers and the other required services
in the disaster recovery (DR) region must be manually activated, and traffic must be 
redirected to the DR site until the primary region has fully recovered from the disaster
as per the below diagram.

![Disaster recovery disaster operation]({{base_path}}/assets/img/setup/deploy/disaster-recovery/disaster-recovery-basic-disaster-operation.png){: width="800" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

To ensure a seamless disaster recovery process, it is important to properly configure 
and test the manual trigger mechanism for starting the servers in the DR region. 
In order to maintain the consistency of data and runtime file artifacts, the data 
replication and file replication services should be configured to switch the 
replication regions as depicted in the diagram. This is to ensure that the latest 
data and file artifacts are synced to the primary region.

After the primary region has fully recovered and all services are operational, the
traffic can then be redirected back to the primary region from the DR region. It is 
important to regularly test and review the DR deployment to ensure its success in the
event of a disaster.
