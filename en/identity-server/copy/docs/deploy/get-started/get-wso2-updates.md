# Get WSO2 Updates

**WSO2 Updates** include any improvements (e.g., bug fixes, security fixes) that are released by WSO2 on top of a released WSO2 product version. With updates, you do not have to wait until the next product version is released to get the fixes you want. Find out more about WSO2 updates at <https://wso2.com/updates>.

<!--You can get updates using the WSO2 in-place updates tool or WSO2 Update Manager (WUM tool). For more information, see [WSO2 Updates](https://docs.wso2.com/display/updates/Introduction).-->
