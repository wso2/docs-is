# Work with the Source Code

The source code of all WSO2 products as well as the scripts that are
used for building WSO2 products are maintained in GitHub repositories.
If you are a developer, you can easily clone the source code from these
Git repositories, and if required, you can do modifications and build a
customized product on your own.

-   To identify the list of repositories that you require, see [WSO2
    GitHub
    Repositories](https://wso2.github.io/github-repositories.html).

    !!! tip     
        Click [Repositories used to build WSO2
        products](https://wso2.github.io/github-repositories.html#IS), and
        clone the repositories that are listed for WSO2 Identity Server.     

-   For more information on building the product, see [Using Maven to
    Build WSO2 Products](https://wso2.github.io/using-maven.html).
    
-   To learn how to contribute to the code base, see [Contributing to
    the Code Base](https://wso2.github.io/).
