# Link User Accounts

WSO2 IS allows linking multiple accounts that a user has and switching between accounts once the user links their accounts. WSO2 IS also allows to connect a user's federated user credentials with their WSO2 Identity Server account. 

Users can link and manage local and federated accounts seamlessly using **My Account**.
